Welcome to the Turing Way
欢迎来到‘图灵之路’
The Turing Way is a lightly opinionated guide to reproducible data science.
《图灵之路》是一本对可复制数据科学的轻量级指导手册。

Our goal is to provide all the information that researchers need at the start of their projects to ensure that they are easy to reproduce at the end.
我们的目标是在研究人员开始项目时，就提供他们所需的所有信息，以确保在项目在之后，这些研究易于被复制。

This also means making sure PhD students, postdocs, PIs, and funding teams know which parts of the “responsibility of reproducibility” they can affect, and what they should do to nudge data science to being more efficient, effective, and understandable.
这也意味着我们需要确保博士生，博士后，PI和资助团队知道他们会影响“可重复性责任”的哪些部分，以及他们应该采取哪些措施，来推动数据科学变得更加高效，有效和易于理解。

 
The book is collaboratively written and open from the start. If you would like to contribute please get in touch or visit our contributing guidelines to learn how to start.
这本书是协作编写的，从一开始就选择公开。如果您想贡献，请与我们联系或访问我们的贡献准则以了解如何开始。

We value the participation of every member of our community and want to ensure that every contributor has an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, everyone who participates in the Turing Way project is expected to show respect and courtesy to other community members at all times. All contributions must abide by our code of conduct.
我们重视社区中每个成员的参与，并希望确保每个贡献者都将拥有愉快而充实的体验。因此，希望参与图灵之路项目的所有人都应始终表现出对其他成员的尊重和礼貌。所有贡献都必须遵守我们的行为准则。

A little more background
一点点简介
Reproducible research is necessary to ensure that scientific work can be trusted. Funders and publishers are beginning to require that publications include access to the underlying data and the analysis code. The goal is to ensure that all results can be independently verified and built upon in future work. This is sometimes easier said than done. Sharing these research outputs means understanding data management, library sciences, sofware development, and continuous integration techniques: skills that are not widely taught or expected of academic researchers and data scientists.
为了确保科学工作值得信赖，必须进行可重复研究。基金和出版商已经开始要求出版物应该包括原始数据和代码的链接。其目的是确保可以独立验证所有结果，并在未来的研究提供支持。这有时候说起来容易做起来难。共享这些研究成果意味着理解数据管理，图书馆学，软件开发和持续集成技术：而这些能力却不是学术研究者和数据科学家广泛学习和期望的技能。

The Turing Way is a handbook to support students, their supervisors, funders, and journal editors in ensuring that reproducible data science is “too easy not to do”. It will include training material on version control, analysis testing, open and transparent communication with future users, and build on Turing Institute case studies and workshops. This project is openly developed and any and all questions, comments and recommendations are welcome at our GitHub repository: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way.
《图灵之路》是一本手册，旨在支持学生，他们的导师，基金方和期刊编辑，以确保复制科学变得简单。它将包括有关版本控制，分析测试，与未来用户的公开透明沟通的培训材料，并会组织以图灵研究所的基础的个案研究和研讨会。这个项目是开放开发的，有任何问题，建议和推荐都欢迎来我们GitHub仓库：https : //github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way。

Summary摘要
There are several definitions of reproducibility in use, and we discuss these in more detail in the definitions section of this chapter. The Turing Way defines reproducibility as data and code being available to fully rerun the analysis. This chapter will lay out why reproducibility is important for science and scientists, provide an overview of the most common definitions, and define reproducibility in the context of this handbook.
对于可重复性现在有几个定义正在使用，我们将在本章的“ 定义”部分中详细讨论这些定义。Turing Way将可重复性定义为可用于完全重新运行分析的数据和代码。本章将阐述为什么可重复性对科学和科学家很重要，概述了最常见的定义，并在本手册的背景下定义了可重复性。

This chapter sets out the definition of reproducibility that the Turing Way project team used when writing this handbook. It will be useful to avoid misunderstandings when reading the rest of the handbook.
本章列出了Turing Way项目团队在编写本手册时使用的可重复性定义。阅读手册的其余部分时，避免误解将非常有用。

Why reproducibility is important for science
为什么可重复性对于科学很重要
Major media outlets have reported on investigations showing that a significant percentage of scientific studies cannot be reproduced. This leads to other academics and society losing trust in scientific results (Baker, 2016). Working reproducibly means others can check your results - even early on in the research process. Thus, the full analysis and methodology is transparent. Scientific results and evidence are strengthened if they are reproduced and confirmed by several independent researchers. With all parts used in an analysis being available and/or documented, valuable time is saved reproducing published results and other researchers can easily build on these resarch results and re-use data or code for their analyses. In addition, so called “negative results” can be published easily, helping avoid other researchers wasting time repeating analyses that will not return the expected results (Dirnagl & Lauritzen, 2010).
主要媒体报道调查显示大量科学研究无法被复制。这正在导致社会和其他研究者对科学成果失去信任（Baker，2016）。可重复地工作意味着其他人可以检查您的结果-甚至早在研究进行时。因此，完整的分析和方法是透明的。如果研究可以得到其他一些独立研究人员的复制和证实，其科学成果和证据将得到加强。通过使用被公开和/或记录的分析，可以节省宝贵的时间来复制已发布的结果，其他研究人员可以轻松地基于这些研究结果并重新使用数据或代码进行分析。此外， “不显著结果”研究的发表可以变得简单，并帮助其他研究者可以避免耗费更多时间来进行类似可能不会得到期待结果的研究。

Why you should care about reproducibility
为什么要关心重现性

Markowetz highlights five reasons to work reproducibly (Markowetz, 2015):
Markowetz强调了重视可重复工作的五个原因（Markowetz，2015年）：

•	Avoiding disaster: By working reproducibly, you can trust your own research results and will not have to retract published results or keep publications back because you cannot reproduce your results.
•	Writing papers easier: Well documented analyses ensure that you have easy access to the latest results, your work can easily be written up, and collaborators can easily get on board as additional authors. Furthermore, you can be sure that you easily comply with the highest-level journal guidelines.
•	Convincing reviewers: Making code and data available to the reviewers means their review comments will be constructive as they are able to develop an in-depth understanding of your work and can even try changes to your analysis themselves and see the impact.
•	Facilitating continuity of work: Well documented work means your work can easily be picked up and continued - either by others in your laboratory, or yourself if you want to build on your own work after a longer period.
•	Building your reputation: Putting in effort to make your research reproducible shows that you are a careful researcher and makes your research results more robust.

•	避免灾难：通过可重复地工作，您可以信任自己的研究结果，从而避免因为您无法复制自己的结果，而撤回已发布的部分结果或从杂志撤稿。
•	撰写论文更容易：记录良好的分析确保您可以轻松访问最新结果，可以轻松进行撰写工作，并且协作者可以轻松地成为共同作者。此外，您可以确定自己很容易满足高影响因子期刊的规则。
•	令审阅人信服：向审阅者提供代码和数据意味着他们的审阅注释将具有建设性，因为他们能够深入了解您的工作，甚至可以自己尝试更改分析并查看影响。
•	促进工作的连续性：记录良好的工作意味着您的工作可以轻松地被延续-如果您想在较长时间后继续自己的工作，你自己甚至实验室中的其他人，都可以轻松继续进行。
•	建立声誉：努力使您的研究具有可重复性，这表明您是一位认真的研究工作者，并使您的研究结果更可靠。

Papers whose underlying data is available get cited more often (Piwowar, Day & Fridsma, 2007; Piwowar & Vision, 2013). All research outputs that are shared can be built upon more easily by others and in some cases, others following up on your work might lead to new collaborations. Other benefits of working openly are covered in our Open Research chapter.
公开数据的论文被引用得更多（Piwowar，Day和Fridsma，2007； Piwowar和Vision，2013）。其他人可以更轻松地建立所有共享的研究成果，在某些情况下，其他跟进您工作的人可能会促进新的合作。公开工作的其他好处将在“ 开放研究”一章中介绍。

Definitions of reproducibility
可重复性的定义
The most common definition of reproducibility (and replication) was first noted by Claerbout and Karrenbach in 1992 and has been used in computational science literature since then. Another popular definition has been introduced in 2013 by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), which swapped the meaning of the terms ‘reproducible’ and ‘replicable’ compared to Claerbout and Karrenbach. The following table contrasts both definitions following Heroux et al. (2018).
最广泛使用的的可再现性（和复制性）定义是Claerbout和Karrenbach于1992年首次提出的，此后收到计算科学领域的广泛采用。2013年，计算机协会（ACM）引入了另一个流行的定义，与Claerbout和Karrenbach相比，该术语调换了“reproducible”和“replicable”两个术语的含义。下表根据Heroux等人的描述对比了这两个定义。（2018）。

Term	Claerbout & Karrenbach	ACM
Reproducible	Authors provide all the necessary data and the computer codes to run the analysis again, re-creating the results.	(Different team, different experimental setup.) The measurement can be obtained with stated precision by a different team, a different measuring system, in a different location on multiple trials. For computational experiments, this means that an independent group can obtain the same result using artifacts which they develop completely independently.
Replicable	A study that arrives at the same scientific findings as another study, collecting new data (possibly with different methods) and completing new analyses.	(Different team, same experimental setup.) The measurement can be obtained with stated precision by a different team using the same measurement procedure, the same measuring system, under the same operating conditions, in the same or a different location on multiple trials. For computational experiments, this means that an independent group can obtain the same result using the author’s own artifacts.

术语	Claerbout和Karrenbach	ACM
Reproducible	作者提供所有必要的数据和代码，以再次运行分析，从而重新创建结果。	（不同的团队，不同的实验设置。）可以由不同的团队，不同的测量系统，在多个试验的不同位置，以规定的精度获得测量值。对于计算实验，这意味着一个独立的小组可以使用完全独立发展的工件来获得相同的结果。
Replicable	获得与另一项研究相同的科学发现，收集新数据（可能使用不同方法）并完成新分析的研究。	（不同的团队，相同的实验设置。）可以由不同的团队使用相同的测量程序，相同的测量系统，在相同的操作条件下，在多个试验的相同或不同位置以规定的精度获得测量值。对于计算实验，这意味着一个独立的小组可以使用作者自己的工件获得相同的结果。

Barba (2018) conducted a detailed literature review on the usage of reproducible/replicable covering several disciplines. Most papers and disciplines use the terminology as defined by Claerbout and Karrenbach, whereas mircobiology, immunology and computer science tend to follow the ACM use of reproducibility and replication. In political science and economics literature, both terms are used interchangeably.
Barba（2018）对可再现/可复制的用法进行了详尽的文献综述，涉及多个学科。大多数论文和学科都使用Claerbout和Karrenbach定义的术语，而微生物学，免疫学和计算机科学则倾向于遵循ACM对再现性和复制性的使用。在政治科学和经济学文献中，两个术语可以互换使用。

In addition to these high level definitions of reporducibility, some authors provide more detailed disctinctions. Victoria Stodden (2014), a prominent scholar on this topic, has for example identified the following further distinctions:
除了可重复性的这些高级定义之外，一些作者还提供了更详细的区分。例如，有关该主题的著名学者Victoria Stodden （2014）指出了以下进一步的区别：

•	Computational reproducibility: When detailed information is provided about code, software, hardware and implementation details.
•	Empirical reproducibility: When detailed information is provided about non-computational empirical scientific experiments and observations. In practice this is enabled by making data freely available, as well as details of how the data was collected.
•	Statistical reproducibility: When detailed information is provided, for example, about the choice of statistical tests, model parameters, and threshold values. This mostly relates to pre-registration of study design to prevent p-value hacking and other manipulations.

•	计算可重复性：当提供有关代码，软件，硬件和实现细节的详细信息时。
•	经验可重复性：当提供有关非计算性经验科学实验和观察的详细信息时。实际上，这是通过免费提供数据以及如何收集数据的详细信息来实现的。
•	统计可重复性：当提供详细信息时，例如，有关统计检验，模型参数和阈值的选择。这主要与研究设计的预先注册有关，以防止p-hacking和其他操纵。

Summary
摘要
Open research aims to transform research by making it more reproducible, transparent, re-usable, collaborative, accountable, and accessible to society. It pushes for change in the way that research is carried out and disseminated by digital tools. One definition of open research, as given by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), is the practice of making “the primary outputs of publicly funded research results – publications and the research data – publicly accessible in digital format with no or minimal restriction.” In order to achieve this openness in research, each element of the research process should:
开放研究旨在转变研究，使其更具可复制性，透明性，可重用性，协作性，问责性和对社会更易使用。它推动了数字工具进行研究和传播方式的变革。经济合作与发展组织（OECD）给出的开放研究的定义是，使“公共资助的研究结果的主要输出-出版物和研究数据-以数字格式公开获得，为了实现研究的开放性，研究过程的每个要素都应：

•	Be publicly available: It is difficult to use and benefit from knowledge hidden behind barriers such as passwords and paywalls.
•	Be reusable: Research outputs need to be licensed appropriately so that prospective users clearly know any limitations on re-use.
•	Be transparent: With appropriate metadata to provide clear statements of how research output was produced and what it contains.

•	公开获取：难以使用，并受益于密码和收费墙等障碍背后的知识。
•	重复使用：研究成果需要获得适当的许可，以便潜在用户清楚地知道重复使用的各项限制。
•	透明化：具有适当的元数据，以明确说明研究成果的产生方式和包含的内容。

The research process typically has the following form: data is collected and then analysed (usually using software). This process may involve the use of specialist hardware. The results of the research are then published. Throughout the process it is good practice for researchers to document their working in notebooks. Open research aims to make each of these elements open:
研究过程通常具有以下形式：收集数据然后进行分析（通常使用软件）。此过程可能涉及使用专业硬件。然后将研究结果发表。在整个过程中，对于研究人员而言，最好在笔记本中记录其工作。公开研究旨在使所有这些要素公开：

•	Open data: Documenting and sharing research data openly for re-use.
•	Open source software: Documenting research code and routines, and making them freely accessible and available.
•	Open hardware: Documenting designs, materials, and other relevant information related to hardware, and making them freely accessible and available.
•	Open access: Making all published outputs freely accessible for maximum use and impact.
•	Open notebooks: An emerging practice, documenting and sharing the experimental process of trial and error.

•	开放数据：公开记录和共享研究数据以供重复使用。
•	开源软件：记录研究代码和程序，并免费提供和使用它们。
•	开放式硬件：记录设计，材料和与硬件有关的其他相关信息，并使其可自由访问和使用。
•	开放获取：使所有已发布的输出可自由访问，以实现最大的使用和影响力。
•	开放式笔记本：一种新兴的实践，记录和共享试验和错误的实验过程。

These elements are expanded upon in this chapter.
这些元素在本章中进行了扩展。

Open scholarship is a concept that extends open research further. It relates to making other aspects of scientific research open to the public, for example:
开放科学是一个进一步扩展开放式研究的概念。它涉及使科学研究的其他方面向公众开放，例如：

•	Open educational resources: Making educational resources publicly available to be re-used and modified.
•	Equity, diversity, inclusion: Ensuring scholarship is open to anyone without barriers based on factors such as race, background, gender, and sexual orientation.
•	Citizen science: The inclusion of members of the public in scientific research.

•	开放式科学：公开提供教育资源以供重新使用和修改。
•	平等，多样性，包容性：确保奖学金任何人开放，而不受种族，背景，性别和性取向等因素的影响。
•	公民科学：将公众吸引进入科学研究。

These elements are also discussed in detail in this chapter.
本章还将详细讨论这些元素。

There are five main schools of thought motivating open practices to benefit research:
有五种主要的思想流派可以促进使研究受益的开放科学的尝试：

School	Belief	Aim

Open practices also benefit the researchers that propagate them. For example there is evidence (Mckiernan et al. 2016) that open access articles are cited more often, as shown by the metastudy presented in the figure below.
开放工作的实践也应该对传播它们的研究人员有益。例如，有证据（Mckiernan等，2016）表明，开放获取文章的引用频率更高，如下图所示的元研究表明。

 

The relative citation rate (OA: non-OA) in 19 fields of research. This rate is defined as the mean citation rate of OA articles divided by the mean citation rate of non-OA articles. Multiple points for the same discipline indicate different estimates from the same study, or estimates from several studies. (See footnote 1 for references.)
在19个研究领域中的相关引用率（OA：非OA）。该比率定义为OA文章的平均引用率除以非OA文章的平均引用率。同一学科的多个点表示同一项研究或多项研究的估计不同。（有关参考，请参见脚注1。）

Another benefit of openness is that while research collaborations are essential to advancing knowledge, identifying and connecting with appropriate collaborators is not trivial. Open practices can make it easier for researchers to connect with one another by increasing the discoverability and visibility of one’s work, facilitating rapid access to novel data and software resources, and creating new opportunities to interact with and contribute to ongoing communal projects.
开放性的另一个好处是，由于研究合作对于促进科研至关重要，但确定适当的合作者并与之建立联系并非易事。开放科研的实践可以通过增加工作的可发现性和可见性，促进对新数据和软件资源的快速访问，并与正在进行的社区项目进行互动和做出贡献的新机会，使研究人员之间的联系更加容易。
Open data
公开数据
The world is witnessing a significant global transformation, facilitated by technology and digital media, and fuelled by data and information. This transformation has enormous potential to foster more transparent, accountable, efficient, responsive, and effective research. Only a very small proportion of the original data is published in conventional journals. Existing policies on data archiving notwithstanding, in today’s practice data are primarily stored in private files, not in secure institutional repositories, and effectively are lost to the public. This lack of data sharing is an obstacle to international research (be it academic, governmental, or commercial) for two main reasons:
世界正在发生重大的全球转型，在技术和数字媒体的促进下，在数据和信息的推动下。这种转变具有巨大的潜力，可以促进更加透明，负责，高效，响应迅速和有效的研究。传统期刊中只发布了很小一部分的原始数据。尽管存在对数据存档的政策，但现在，数据主要存储在私有文件中，而不是在安全的机构存储库中，实际上失去了公开性。缺乏数据共享是国际研究（学术，政府或商业）的障碍，其主要原因有两个：

1.	It is generally difficult or impossible to fully reproduce a study without the original data.
2.	The data cannot be reused or incorporated into new work by other researchers if they cannot obtain access to it.

1.	如果没有原始数据，通常很难或不可能完全进行复制研究。
2.	如果其他研究人员无法访问数据，则不能重复使用这些数据或将其合并到新工作中。

Accordingly, there is an ongoing global data revolution that seeks to advance collaboration and the creation and expansion of effective, efficient research programs. Open data is crucial to meeting these objectives. Open data is freely available on the internet and any user is permitted to download, copy, analyse, re-process, and re-use it for any other purpose with minimal financial, legal, and technical barriers. This represents a real shift in how research works. At the moment anyone who wishes to use data from a researcher often has to contact that researcher and make a request. “Open by default” turns this on its head and says that there should be a presumption of publication for all. If access to data is restricted, for instance due to security reasons, the justification for this should be made clear. Free access to, and subsequent use of, data is of significant value to society and the economy, and that data should, therefore, be open by default. So, how do you go about making your data open?
因此，全球数据革命正在进行，以促进协作以及促进创建和扩展高效的研究项目。开放数据对于实现这些目标至关重要。开放数据可在网上免费获得，并且允许任何用户下载，复制，分析，重新处理和重用于其他目的，同时将支出，法律和技术障碍降至最低。这代表了研究工作的真正转变。目前，几乎任何人希望使用他人数据都通常需要联系该数据的研究人员来并提出请求。“默认公开”的意思则相反，数据提前说明可以为所有人公开。假如由于安全原因而限制了数据访问，则应说明其理由。免费访问和随后使用数据对社会和经济具有重大价值，因此默认情况下应开放数据。那么，如何进行数据公开？

Steps to make your data open
公开数据的步骤
Step 1: Make your data available
第1步：使您的数据可用

Put your data online. It should be easily discoverable and accessible, and made available without bureaucratic or administrative barriers, which can deter people from accessing the data. Choose a location to store the data which will ensure historical copies of datasets are preserved, archived, and kept accessible as long as they retain value. Whenever possible, researchers should provide data in its original, unmodified form.
将您的数据传入网络。它应该易于被发现和访问，并且应该在没有政治或管理束缚的情况下可用，以免阻碍人们访问数据。选择一个存储数据的位置，以确保数据集的历史副本在保留其价值的情况下得以保留，存档和保持可访问性。研究人员应尽可能以原始的，未经修改的形式提供数据。

Data should be free of charge, under an open licence, (for example, those developed by Creative Commons) so it can be reused and remixed by other researchers. The data should be available as a whole and at no more than a reasonable reproduction cost. That is, no expensive piece of software should be required to read the file as this may obstruct researchers who wish to work with the dataset.
在开放许可下，数据应该是免费的（例如，由Creative Commons开发的数据），以便其他研究人员可以重复使用和重新合成。数据应该是整体可用的，最多收取合理的复制成本。也就是说，不需要昂贵的软件来读取文件，因为这可能会妨碍希望使用数据集的研究人员。

Step 2: Make your data easy to understand
第2步：使您的数据易于理解

Having data available is of no use if it cannot be understood. For example, a table of numbers is useless if there are no headings which describe the contents of the rows and columns. Therefore you should ensure that open datasets include consistent core metadata, and that the data is fully described. This requires that all documentation accompanying data is written in clear, plain language, and that data users have sufficient information to understand the source, strengths, weaknesses, and analytical limitations of the data so that they can make informed decisions when using it.
如果无法理解数据，则数据将不可用。例如，如果没有标题描述行和列的内容，则数字表是无用的。因此，您应确保开放的数据集包含一致的核心元数据，并且数据已被完整描述。这就要求数据附件的所有文档均以清晰明了的语言编写，并且数据用户应具有足够的信息来理解数据的来源，优势，劣势和分析其局限性，以便他人在使用数据时可以做出明智的决策。

Step 3: Make your data easy to use
第3步：使您的数据易于使用

The data should be made available in a modifiable, machine-readable format so that it can be effectively used and manipulated. It is also important to think about the file formats that information is provided in. Data should be presented in structured and standardized formats to support interoperability, traceability, and effective reuse. In many cases, this will include providing data in multiple, standardized formats, so that it can be processed by computers and used by people.
数据应以可修改的电子可读格式提供，以便可以有效地使用和操作。考虑提供信息的文件格式也很重要。数据应以结构化和标准化的格式表示，以支持交互性，可追溯性和有效的重用使用性。在许多情况下，这将包括以多种标准化格式提供数据，以便可以由计算机处理和他人使用。

Step 4: Make your data citeable
第4步：使您的数据可引用

Data should be considered a legitimate, citable product of research. Making data citeable (and citing data yourself) facilitates the giving of scholarly credit; in scholarly literature, whenever and wherever a claim relies upon data, the corresponding data should be cited. Data citations facilitate identification of, access to, and verification of the specific data that support a claim, making it possible to reproduce the underlying analysis. You should ensure that anyone who wishes to cite a dataset that you host has access to a persistent identifier in order to do so.
数据应被视为合法，可引用的研究成果。使数据可引用（并自己引用数据）有助于获得学术荣誉；在学术文献中，无论何时何地使用数据，都应引用相应的数据来源。数据引用有助于识别，访问和验证特定数据，从而可以重现基础分析。您应该确保任何希望引用您数据集的人都可以找到并访问您的持久性标识符。

A data citation should include a persistent method for identification that is unique, and widely understandable by a community. There are several types of persistent identifier that could be used to identify datasets: examples include Handles, Archival Resource Keys (ARKs) and Persistent URLs (PURLs), all of which can be resolved to an Internet location. The scheme that is gaining most traction is the Digital Object Identifier (DOI).
数据引用应包括一种唯一的且大众可以广泛理解的持久性标识方法。有几种类型的持久标识符可用于标识数据集：示例包括句柄，档案资源密钥（ARK）和持久URL（PURL），所有这些都可以解析为互联网的位置。获得最大关注的方案是数字对象标识符（DOI）。

The DOI System is an identifier scheme administered by the International DOI Foundation. The task of managing DOI registers is delegated to registration agencies (for a list, see here) that each specialise in a type of resource. For research datasets, the registration agency is the DataCite Consortium. Among the services it provides are human and machine interfaces for simple end-user administration of DOI registrations. DataCite also collects metadata about each dataset it registers so they can be more easily understood and identified. Any repository wishing to register DOIs needs to obtain a username and password from DataCite to gain access to the registration service. While best practice has yet to emerge on some matters, certain conventions are already becoming established.
DOI系统是由国际DOI基金会管理的标识符方案。管理DOI注册的任务被委托给注册机构（有关列表，请参见此处），不同的资源都有相应的专门机构。对于研究数据集，注册机构是DataCite联盟。它提供的服务包括人机界面，用于用户对DOI注册的简单管理。DataCite还收集有关其注册的每个数据集的元数据，以便可以更轻松地理解和识别它们。任何希望注册DOI的存储库都需要从DataCite获取用户名和密码，以访问注册服务。尽管在某些问题上尚未出现最佳的方案，但某些公约已经确立。

In particular, when organisations register a DOI for a resource, they should not introduce semantic elements into the suffix, especially not metadata that might change over time (for example, publisher, archive, owner). Assign identifiers to static datasets only when no further changes or corrections are expected (such as after quality control checks are complete). As DOIs are used to cite data as evidence, the resource to which a DOI points should also remain unchanged, with any new version receiving a new DOI.
特别是，当组织为某种资源注册DOI时，他们不应在后缀中引入语义元素，尤其是不会随时间变化的元数据（例如，发布者，档案馆，所有者）。仅在不需要进一步的更改或更正（例如，完成质量控制检查之后）时，才将标识符分配给静态数据集。由于需要将DOI引用作为证据，因此DOI指向的资源也应保持不变，任何新版本都将收到新的DOI。

Furthermore, whichever identifier scheme you pick make sure it allows the identifier to be resolved to a URL. This URL should belong to a landing page that contains descriptive information about the dataset, as well as links or instructions for accessing it. You should also ensure that datasets are made citable and identifiable at an appropriate level of granularity. For example, it would be no use citing CERN’s entire data repository as someone attempting to reproduce your work would not be able to find the data used in a specific piece of work without considerable difficulty. Where possible you should be able to cite the data used, and only the data used.
此外，无论您选择哪种标识符方案，都要确保它允许将标识符解析为URL。该URL应该属于登录页面，该页面包含有关数据集的描述性信息以及访问该数据集的链接或说明。您还应确保以适当的粒度级别使数据集可被引用和识别。例如，引用CERN的整个数据存储库是没有用的，因为尝试复制您的作品的人将很难找到特定作品中使用的数据。在可能的情况下，您应该能够引用所使用的数据，并且仅引用所使用的数据。


Barriers to data sharing
数据共享的障碍

Sometimes it may not be possible to make data publicly available in its entirety or even in part. There are two main reasons this may be the case:
有时可能无法全部或部分公开数据。可能是由于两个主要原因：

Privacy
隐私
Many fields of research involve working with sensitive personal data, medical research being the most obvious example. Individuals must be protected from (re)identification via their personal data used for research. Anonymisation of the data may be sufficient in some cases, but ensuring that reidentification is not possible is becoming increasingly difficult due to technical progress, growing computational power and – ironically – more open data. For example, reidentification may be possible via data-mining of accessible data and so-called quasi-identifiers, a set of (common) properties that are – in their combination – so specific that they can be used to identify individuals.
许多研究领域都涉及处理敏感的个人数据，最明显的例子就是医学研究。必须保护用于研究的个人数据免受（重新）识别。在某些情况下，对数据进行匿名化可能就足够了，但是由于技术的进步和计算能力的提高，具有讽刺意味的是，更开放的数据在确保无法重新识别的问题上变得越来越困难。例如，通过可访问数据和所谓的准标识符的数据挖掘，重新识别是可能的，准标识符是一组（共同的）属性，它们的组合非常具体，可以用来识别个人。

Preserving privacy may still be possible if partial or generalised datasets are provided. For example, providing age bands instead of birth date or only the first two digits of postal codes. It may also be possible to provide the data in such a format that researchers can query it whist keeping the data itself closed, for example, a user may be able to send a query to retrieve the mean of a dataset, but not be able to access any of the individual datapoints.
即使提供了部分或通用数据集，其实仍然可以保护隐私。例如，提供年龄段而不是出生日期或仅提供邮政编码的前两位数字。也有可能以一种格式提供数据，以使研究人员可以查询它，同时保持数据本身关闭，例如，用户可能能够发送查询以检索数据集的均值，但不能访问任何单个数据点。

National and commercially sensitive data
国家和商业敏感数据

In many cases companies are understandably unwilling to publish much of their data. The reasoning goes that if commercially sensitive information is disclosed, it will damage the company’s commercial interests and undermine competitiveness. This is based on the thinking that in competitive markets, innovation will only occur with some protection of information: if a company spends time and money developing something new, the details of which are then made public, then its competitors can easily copy it without having to invest the same resources. The result is that no-one would innovate in the first place. Similarly, governments are often unwilling to publish data that relates to issues such as national security due to public safety concerns.
在许多情况下，公司不愿意发布许多数据是可以理解的。理由是，如果公开商业敏感信息，它将损害公司的商业利益并损害其竞争力。这是基于以下想法：在竞争激烈的市场中，创新只会在保护信息的情况下发生：如果公司花费时间和金钱开发新的东西，然后将其细节公开，那么竞争对手就可以轻松地复制它而无需投资相同的资源。结果是，没有人会首先进行创新。同样，由于公共安全问题，政府通常不愿发布与国家安全等问题相关的数据。

In such cases it may not be possible to make data open, or it may only be only possible to share partial/obscured datasets as outlined in the section above on privacy.
在这种情况下，可能无法打开数据，或者仅可能共享部分/模糊的数据集，如上一节“隐私”所述。

Open source software
开源软件
What is open source software?
什么是开源软件
When a project is open source anybody can view, use, modify, and distribute the project for any purpose. These permissions are enforced through an open source licence. Open source is powerful because it lowers the barriers to adoption, allowing ideas to spread quickly. In its most basic form, open sourcing your software simply means putting your code online where it can be viewed and reused by others.
当项目是开源项目时，任何人都可以出于任何目的查看，使用，修改和分发项目。这些权限通过开放源代码许可证实施。开源之所以强大是因为它降低了使用的障碍，使思想得以迅速传播。在最基本的形式中，开源软件只是意味着将您的代码在线存放在其他人可以查看和重复使用的地方。

Many of the most widely used research software is open source. Perhaps the paradigmatic example is the scikit-learn Python package for machine learning (Pedregosa et al., 2011), which, in the space of just over five years, has attracted over 500 unique contributors, 20,000 individual code contributions, and 2,500 article citations. Producing a comparable package using a traditional closed-source approach would likely not be feasible, and would, at the very least, have required a budget of tens of millions of dollars. While scikit-learn is clearly an outlier, hundreds of other open source packages that support much more domain-specific needs depend in a similar fashion on unsolicited community contributions, for example, the NIPY (neuroimaging in Python) group of projects in neuroimaging (Gorgolewski et al., 2016). Importantly, such contributions not only result in new functionality from which the broader community can benefit, but also regularly provide their respective authors with greater community recognition, and lead to new project and employment opportunities.
许多最常用的软件都是开源的。最典型的例子是用于机器学习的Python软件包scikit-learn（Pedregosa等，2011），在短短五年的时间里，它已经吸引了500多个独特的贡献者，20,000个单独的代码贡献和2,500篇文章引用。使用传统闭源方法写成可比较的软件包可能不可行，并且至少需要数千万美元的预算。尽管scikit-learn很明显是一个极值，但支持其他更多特定领域需求的数百个其他开源程序包也以类似的方式依赖于未经请求的社区贡献，例如，神经成像（Gorgolewski）中的NIPY（Python中的Neuroimaging）项目组等人，2016年）。更重要的是，这样的贡献不仅促进使更广大受众可以从中受益的新功能，而且还可以定期为各自的作者提供更大的社区认可度，并带来新的项目和就业机会。

Researchers that make use of open source software often make changes to them such as adding features they need for their own research, or fixing bugs. They can then contribute these improvements back to the main project so the wider community can take advantage of them.
使用开源软件的研究人员经常对其进行更改，例如添加自己的研究所需的功能或修复错误。然后，他们可以将这些改进反回到主要项目中，以便更广泛的受众可以利用它们。


How running and contributing to open source software projects benefits you
运行开源软件项目并为之做出贡献如何使您受益

•	Improve existing skills: Whether it is coding, user interface design, graphic design, writing, or organizing, if you are looking for practice, there is a task for you on an open source software project. Further, open source necessitates cleaner, more maintainable code to enable collaboration between potentially thousands of people who may never meet. This helps to build and maintain good coding habits. Not to be underestimated are the people skills you can develop on open source software projects. Open source offers opportunities to practice leadership and management skills, such as resolving conflicts, organising teams of people, and prioritising work.
提高现有技能：无论是编程，用户界面设计，图形设计，写作还是组织，如果您正在寻找实践方式，那么在开源软件项目上总有一项任务供您选择。此外，开源需要更干净，更可维护的代码，以实现潜在的成千上万从未见过的人之间的协作。这有助于建立和保持良好的编码习惯。不要低估您可以在开源软件项目中开发的人际技能。开源为实践领导和管理技能提供了机会，例如解决冲突，组织人员团队和确定工作优先级。

•	Advance your career: By definition, all of your open source work is public and this presents opportunities:
促进您的职业发展：根据定义，您的所有开源工作都是公开的，这会带来机遇：

o	Demonstrate technical ability: Technical interviews traditionally involve working on a simulated problem that can be tackled in a set amount of time with little additional context. Such simulations, by definition, are not real world use cases, nor do they show what working with an applicant would be like. Open source provides visibility into both how a candidate solves problems, and how they work with others. You make a much more appealing employee if an employer can see the quality of your work and see you working with others over a long period of time rather than taking a chance on a single short, high-stress case which may not play to your strengths.
展示技术能力：传统上，技术面试涉及解决一个模拟问题，该问题可以在一定时间范围内解决，但几乎没有其他上下文。从定义上讲，这样的模拟不是真实的实用案例，也不能显示与候选人合作的样子。开源可以使候选人了解如何解决问题以及如何与他人合作。如果雇主可以看到您的工作质量并看到您长时间与他人一起工作，而不是偶然碰到一个可能无法发挥您优势的短暂，高压力的案例，那么您将成为更具吸引力的员工。

o	Reputation: Becoming an active member of the open source community can gain you a positive reputation which may bolster future job prospects.
声誉：成为开源社区的活跃成员可以为您赢得正面的声誉，这可以巩固未来的就业前景。

•	Meet people with similar interests: Open source software projects with warm, welcoming communities keep people coming back for years and many people form lifelong friendships through their participation in open source.
结识志趣相投的人：社区热情友好的开放源代码软件项目可以使人们回味很多年，许多人通过参与开放源代码建立了终身友谊。

•	Find mentors and teach others: Working with others on a shared project means you will have to explain how you do things, as well as ask other people for help. The acts of learning and teaching can be a fulfilling activity for everyone involved.
寻找导师并教别人：与他人一起从事共享项目意味着您将必须解释自己的处事方式，并向他人寻求帮助。学与教的行为对于每个参与人员而言都是一项充实的活动。


Making your own work open source
使自己的工作开源

•	Re-usability: Making your work openly available for re-use makes it easier for others to incorporate into their own research. If you make your software citeable, for example via a DOI this can increase your citations.
可重用性：使您的工作可公开使用，以使其他人更容易融入自己的研究中。如果您使软件可引用，例如通过DOI，则可以增加引用。

•	When you write closed source software, the only developers that can potentially detect, diagnose, triage, and resolve software bugs are those that have a copy of the code. If your project is open the number of potentially contributing developers and thus the potential knowledge pool is orders of magnitude larger.
当您编写封闭源代码软件时，唯一可以检测，诊断，分类和解决软件错误的开发人员是拥有代码副本的开发人员。如果您的项目是开放的，有贡献的开发人员的数量可能将增加，因此潜在的知识库将数量级增长。

•	Feedback: Making your work open enables you to get feedback and improve your project in way you may never have thought of alone.
反馈：开放工作使您能够获得反馈，并以您从未想过的方式改进项目。

•	Accountability: There is an argument that any software developed using government money should be open source by default; if the public has paid for its development they have a right to make use of it. If your work is government funded making it open is a step you can take towards government openness and accountability.
问责制：有人争论说，使用政府资金开发的任何软件都应默认为开源；如果公众为发展付出了代价，则他们有权使用它。如果您的工作是由政府资助的，则将其开放是您可以迈向政府开放和问责制的一步。
Contributing to others’ open source software projects
为他人的开源软件项目做贡献
•	It is empowering to be able to make changes, even small ones: You do not have to become a lifelong contributor to enjoy participating in open source. Have you ever seen a typo on a website, and wished someone would fix it? On an open source software project, you can do just that. Open source helps people feel agency over their lives and how they experience the world, and that in itself is gratifying.
它可以进行更改，甚至很小的更改：您不必成为终身贡献者就可以享受开源的乐趣。您是否曾经在网站上看到过错字，并希望有人解决？在一个开源软件项目上，您可以做到这一点。开源可以帮助人们在他们的生活以及对世界的体验中感受到价值，这本身就是可喜的。

•	It is fun: Open source provides an endless, ever-changing set of Rubix cubes for you to solve on weekends. Just like puzzles, both crossword and jigsaw, open source provides bite-sized intellectual escapes.
有趣：开放源代码提供了无尽，不断变化的Rubix多维数据集，供您在周末解决。就像填字游戏和拼图游戏一样，开放资源也可以提供益智游戏的快乐。

How open source software benefits research
开源软件如何使研究受益

Open source software projects primarily benefit research by allowing researchers to take advantage of each others’ work. This enables researchers to apply their efforts to high-value work. It is sometimes said that “all the easy problems have already been solved”. Blogging, content management, and operating systems are all problems with established (and mainstream) open source solutions, to name a few. While developers could spend their time reinventing wheels that the open source community have already perfected, it is highly preferable to use the world’s best wheel, especially when that wheel comes at no cost to you. This frees researchers up to work on yet-unsolved challenges. This reduces duplication of effort and allows researchers to focus on the work they’re actually interested in.
开源软件项目主要通过允许研究人员利用彼此的工作来使研究受益。这使研究人员能够将自己的努力应用于高价值的工作。有时有人说“所有简单的问题都已经解决了”。比如，博客，内容管理和操作系统都可以得到已建立的和主流的开源解决方案。虽然开发人员可以花时间重新设计开源社区已经完善的轮子，但是最好的方式是使用世界上最好的轮子，尤其是在您不花钱的情况下。这使研究人员腾出精力来应对尚未解决的挑战。这减少了重复劳动，并使研究人员可以专注于他们实际感兴趣的工作。

Working openly also allows any number of researchers to collaborate on projects that could not possibly be developed by single researchers/research groups. Examples include Linux operating systems, Python packages such as scipy and numpy, and the machine learning library TensorFlow.
公开开展工作还允许任何数量的研究人员就单个研究人员/研究小组无法开发的项目进行合作。示例包括Linux操作系统，诸如scipy和numpy之类的Python软件包以及机器学习库TensorFlow。

How to run your own open source software project
如何运行自己的开源软件项目

You can open source an idea, a work in progress, or after years of being closed source. At the most basic level all you need to do is put your code online somewhere that is likely to last a long time. You can make your code citeable by assigning it a DOI (as discussed in the section on making data citeable). This helps ensure that you get proper credit if people use or build upon your work.
您可以将想法，正在进行中的工作或多年封闭后的资源开源。在最基本的层次上，您需要做的就是将代码在线放置在可能会持续很长时间的地方。您可以通过为代码分配一个DOI来使其成为可引用的（如关于使数据可引用的部分所述）。如果人们使用或以您的工作为基础，这有助于确保您获得适当的信誉。

A popular place to make your code available is GitHub (see the chapter on version control). You must include a licence file stating that anyone has permission to use, copy, and modify your work. Without this no one can legally use your work and so it isn’t open source. This website offers a very simple mechanism to help you pick the best licence for your project. There are also a few other files you should include with your code, as described below.
GitHub是一个公开的常用场所（请参阅有关版本控制的章节）。您必须包括一个许可证文件，说明任何人都有权使用，复制和修改您的工作。没有这个，没有人可以合法地使用您的作品，因此它不是开源的。该网站提供了一种非常简单的机制，可以帮助您为项目选择最佳许可证。如下所述，您还应在代码中包含一些其他文件。

Welcome users by adding information to your README
通过read me文件中添加信息来欢迎用户

You should include a readme file where you include useful information about what the project is, how to use it, and how to contribute to it. Here’s a list of the main things a readme should include:
您应该包括一个自述文件，其中包含有关项目内容，如何使用它以及如何做出贡献的有用信息。这是自述文件应包括的主要内容的列表：

•	The project name and what it is: This will greatly help someone that comes across it to get an idea of the project. Include a few key points that describe the main features of the project and what are the main features you’re implementing. This helps to quickly compare other projects with yours and to give an idea that why the project exists in the first place.
项目名称及其含义：这将极大地帮助遇到它的人了解该项目。包括一些描述项目主要功能以及要实现的主要功能的关键点。这有助于快速将其他项目与您的项目进行比较，并让您知道为什么该项目优先存在。

•	Instructions on how to install the project: The installer might be a collaborator, someone that comes across and is interested in the project, or even you if you get a new machine and need to re-install your project. Nevertheless, it is a total waste of both of your resources to start figuring out how to just get started with the project. This should also include any prerequisites that will be needed to run the project. The best thing you can do is to just write up the installation instructions when you first do them yourself, and you’ll quickly save hours of work in the future.
有关如何安装项目的说明：安装者可能是协作者，或遇到该项目并对该项目感兴趣的人，有时如果您有新机器并需要重新安装项目，您也会成为安装者。但是，如果你仅仅考虑如何开始这个项目，这完全是浪费你的资源。这还应该包括运行该项目所需的任何先决条件。最好的方法是，在您自己动手安装时，写出安装说明，您将在以后迅速节省工作时间。

•	Instructions for how to run the code and any associated tests: If you’ve been working on your project it may seem obvious how to run it, but this will likely not be the case for someone coming across it for the first time.
有关如何运行代码和任何相关测试的说明：如果您一直在从事项目工作，那么如何运行它看起来似乎很明显，但是对于初次接触它的人来说，情况可能并非如此。

•	Links to related material.
链接到相关材料。

•	List of authors/contributors to the project, possibly with contact information.
该项目的作者/贡献者列表，可能还包含联系信息。

•	Acknowledgements.
致谢。

If you intend for other people to collaborate on your project (as opposed to just making your code available and considering it complete) then you should include contributing guidelines and most likely a code of conduct.
如果您打算让其他人在您的项目上进行协作（而不是仅仅提供您的代码并认为它已经完成），那么您应该包括提供指导方针和最有可能的行为准则。

Contributing guidelines
贡献指导条例
Contributing guidelines tell your audience how to participate in your project. For example, you might include information on:
参与准则可以告诉听众如何参与您的项目。例如，您可能包括以下信息：

•	How to file a bug report.
如何提交错误报告。
•	How to suggest a new feature.
如何建议一项新功能。
•	Your roadmap or vision for the project.
您对项目的路线图或愿景。
•	How contributors should (or should not) get in touch with you.
贡献者应如何（或不应该）与您联系。

Using a warm, friendly tone and offering specific suggestions for contributions (such as writing documentation, or making a website) can go a long way in making newcomers feel welcomed and excited to participate. For example, Active Admin starts its contributing guide with: “First off, thank you for considering contributing to Active Admin. It’s people like you that make Active Admin such a great tool.”
使用热情、友好的语气，并提供具体的贡献建议(如编写文档或制作网站)，可以让新人感到受欢迎和兴奋。例如，主动管理开始其贡献指南:“首先，感谢你考虑为Active Admin做出贡献。正是像你这样的人让Active Admin成为了一个非常棒的工具。”
In the earliest stages of your project, your contributing guidelines file can be simple. You should always explain how to report bugs or file issues, and any technical requirements (like tests) to make a contribution. Over time, you might add other frequently asked questions here or in your readme file. Writing down this information means fewer people will ask you the same questions over and over again. It’s also a good idea to link to your contributing guidelines file from your readme, so more people see it.
在项目的最早阶段，您的贡献指南文件可能很简单。您应该始终说明如何报告错误或问题，以及做出任何贡献的技术要求（例如测试）。随着时间的推移，您可能会在此处或read me中添加其他常见问题。写下这些信息意味着更少的人会重复问您同样的问题。从您的read me链接到您的贡献性准则文件也是一个好主意，以便更多的人看到它。

Code of conduct
行为守则

A code of conduct helps set ground rules for behaviour for your project’s participants. This is especially valuable if you are launching an open source project for a community or company. A code of conduct empowers you to facilitate healthy, constructive community behaviour, which will reduce your stress as a maintainer. In addition to communicating how you expect participants to behave, a code of conduct also tends to describe who these expectations apply to, when they apply, and what to do if a violation occurs.
行为准则有助于为项目参与者设置行为的基本规则。如果您要为社区或公司启动一个开源项目，那么这特别有价值。行为准则使您能够促进健康的，建设性的社区行为，从而减轻维护者的压力。除了传达您期望参与者的行为方式之外，行为准则还倾向于描述这些期望适用于哪些人，何时适用以及发生违规时应采取的措施。

Much like open source licences, there are also emerging standards for codes of conduct, so you don’t have to write your own. The Contributor Covenant is a drop-in code of conduct that is used by over 40,000 open source projects. No matter which text you use, you should be prepared to enforce your code of conduct when necessary.
就像开源许可证一样，也有新兴的行为准则标准，因此您不必自己编写。该贡献者公约是一个简易的行为准则被应用在40000个开源项目中。无论使用哪种文本，都应准备在必要时执行行为准则。
Keep the file in your project’s root directory so it’s easy to find, and link to it from your readme.
将文件保存在项目的根目录中，以便轻松查找并从read me链接到该文件。

How to contribute to other’s open source software projects
如何为他人的开源软件项目做出贡献

Anatomy of an open source software project
开源软件项目剖析

Every open source community is different. That said, many open source software projects follow a similar organizational structure. Understanding the different community roles and overall process will help you get quickly oriented to any new project.
每个开源社区都是不同的。也就是说，许多开源软件项目都遵循类似的组织结构。了解不同的社区角色和总体流程将帮助您快速适应任何新项目。

A typical open source software project has the following types of people:
典型的开源软件项目具有以下几种类型的人员：

•	Author: The person/s or organization that created the project
作者：创建项目的个人或组织

•	Owner: The person/s who has administrative ownership over the organization or repository (not always the same as the original author)
所有者：对组织或存储库具有管理所有权的人（不一定总是与原始作者相同）

•	Maintainers: Contributors who are responsible for driving the vision and managing the organizational aspects of the project. They may also be authors and/or owners of the project.
维护者：负责推动并管理项目组织方面的贡献者。他们也可能是项目的作者和/或所有者。

•	Contributors: Everyone who has contributed something back to the project.
贡献者：每个为项目做出贡献的人。

•	Community members: People who use the project. They might be active in conversations or express their opinion on the project’s direction.
社区成员：使用该项目的人。他们可能会积极参与对话或表达对项目目标方向的看法。

Bigger projects may also have subcommittees or working groups focused on different tasks, such as tooling, triage, community moderation, and event organizing. Look on a project’s website for a “team” page, or in the repository for governance documentation, to find this information.
更大的项目也可能有专门处理不同任务的小组委员会或工作组，例如工具、分类、社区审核和活动组织。在项目的网站上寻找“团队”页面，或者在管理文档的仓库中寻找这些信息。
A great many open source projects are hosted on GitHub (see the chapter on version control for more detail), which has facilities such as:
GitHub上托管了许多开源项目（有关更多详细信息，请参见版本控制一章），该项目具有以下功能：

•	Issue tracker: Where people discuss issues related to the project.
问题跟踪器：人们讨论与项目有关的问题的地方。

•	Pull requests: Where people discuss and review changes that are in progress.
拉取请求：人们在这里讨论和审查正在进行的更改。

•	Discussion forums or mailing lists: Some projects may use these channels for conversational topics (for example, “How do I…” or “What do you think about…” instead of bug reports or feature requests). Others use the issue tracker for all conversations.
讨论论坛或邮件列表：某些项目可能使用这些渠道来进行对话主题（例如，“我怎么...”或“您怎么看……”，而不是错误报告或功能请求）。其他人将问题跟踪器用于所有对话。

•	Synchronous chat channel: Some projects use chat channels (such as Slack or IRC) for casual conversation, collaboration, and quick exchanges.
同步聊天频道：某些项目使用聊天频道（例如Slack或IRC）进行休闲对话，协作和快速交流。

Contribute your changes
贡献你的改变

Say you have added a feature or fixed a bug and want to contribute this work to the main project.
假设您已经添加了一个功能或修复了一个错误，并且希望将这项工作贡献给主项目。
1.	Read the documentation: The main project may have contributing guidelines or information in a readme instructing prospective contributors on how to supply their changes.
2.	Make sure your conventions match those of the main project, both in style and structure: For example if all the variables in a project are named in some particular way yours should be too! Consistent conventions make it much easier for someone who has not seen your piece of the project before to understand it rather than having to figure out your particular set of conventions and what the code is doing. The project’s conventions may be outlined in its documentation, or may just be evident from inspection of the code itself.
3.	Break your changes up into manageable, well-defined chunks: For example, if you have added two separate features don’t submit them together. Keeping things “clean” in this way makes your work simpler to understand and review.
4.	Test your changes: If the project comes with tests run them, and make sure you’re testing against an up to date version of the project as it may have evolved considerably over time. Write specific tests for your changes and submit those too.
5.	Do not just submit code, update relevant documentation too: If your changes are incorporated it will have to be updated, if you don not do it someone else will have to.
6.	Ask questions: If there are things you are unsure about there’s no harm in asking. Many larger projects have dedicated forums or other venues for questions and discussion.
7.	Be clear: When you submit your changes clearly describe the changes you have made, why you have made them, and how they have been implemented. This makes it as easier for someone looking at your work and deciding whether to incorporate it into the main project to do so. In the likely case the main project is hosted on GitHub you should put this in the pull request (see the version control chapter for more details).


1.	阅读文档：主项目中的read me中可能包含有帮助的指南或信息，以指导潜在的参与者提供如何进行更改。
2.	确保您的约定在样式和结构上都与主项目的约定相符：例如，如果项目中的所有变量都以某种特定的方式命名，您的约定也应如此！一致的约定使以前从未看过您项目的人员更容易理解它，而不必弄清楚您的特定约定和代码在做什么。该项目的约定可以在其文档中概述，也可以仅通过检查代码本身。
3.	将更改分为可管理的，定义明确的块状结构：例如，如果添加了两个单独的功能，则不要将它们一起提交。以这种方式保持事物“干净”可以使您的工作更易于理解和审查。
4.	测试您的更改：如果项目附带测试，请运行它们，并确保您正在针对该项目的最新版本进行测试，因为它可能随着时间的推移而发生很大变化。为您的更改编写特定的测试，然后提交。
5.	不要只是提交代码，也要更新相关文档：如果您的更改被合并，则必须进行更新，如果您不这样做，则必须由他人进行。
6.	提出问题：如果您不确定某些事情，多问问不会有任何错。许多较大的项目都有专门的论坛或其他场所来提问和讨论。
7.	要清楚：提交更改时，请清楚描述所做的更改，为什么进行更改以及如何实现。这使得某人查看您的工作并决定是否将其合并到主项目中变得更加容易。在可能的情况下，主项目托管在GitHub上，则应将其放在pull请求中（有关更多详细信息，请参见版本控制一章）。

Looking for projects to contribute to and how to contribute to them
寻找项目并对它进行贡献以及如何为它们做出贡献

You do not need to overthink what exactly your first contribution will be, or how it will look. Instead, start by thinking about the projects you already use, or want to use. The projects you will actively contribute to are the ones you find yourself coming back to. Within those projects, whenever you catch yourself thinking that something could be better or different, act on your instinct. You might scan a readme and find a broken link or a typo. Or you are a new user and you noticed something is broken, or an issue that you think should really be in the documentation. Instead of ignoring it and moving on, or asking someone else to fix it, see whether you can help out by pitching in. That is what open source is all about!
您无需过多考虑您的第一个贡献将是什么，或者看起来如何。相反，请先考虑您已经使用或想要使用的项目。您将积极参与的项目是您发现自己经常查看的项目。在这些项目中，每当您发现自己认为某事可能更好或更不同时，请根据自己的本能行事。您可能会阅读read me文件，发现链接断开或输入错误。或者您是新用户，并且发现某些问题已损坏，或者您认为应该确实存在于文档中的问题。而不是忽略它并继续前进，或者让其他人修复它，而是看看您是否可以通过介入来提供帮助。这就是开源的全部意义所在！

You can also use one of the following resources to help you discover and contribute to new projects:
您还可以使用以下资源之一来帮助您发现新项目并做出贡献：

•	Open Source Friday
•	First Timers Only
•	CodeTriage

•	星期五开源
•	仅限初学者
•	CodeTriage

If you are not sure how to start here is a few other ways you can go about it such as finding an open issue to tackle or asking if you can help write a new feature.
如果您不确定如何从这里开始，还有其他一些解决方法，例如找到要解决的悬而未决的问题或询问是否可以帮助编写新功能。

A common misconception about contributing to open source is that you need to contribute code. In fact, it is often the other parts of a project that are most neglected or overlooked. You will do the project a huge favour by offering to pitch in with these types of contributions! You could:
关于开源的一个普遍误解是您需要贡献代码。实际上，通常是项目的其他部分最容易被忽视或忽视。通过参与这些类型的贡献，您将为该项目带来巨大的帮助！你可以：

•	Review code on other people’s submissions.
•	Write and improve the project’s documentation.
•	Curate a folder of examples showing how the project is used.
•	Answer questions about the project on, for example, Stack Overflow,
•	Keep things organized, for example, on GitHub by:
o	Linking to duplicate issues.
o	Suggesting new issue labels.
o	Going through open issues and suggesting closing old ones.
o	Ask clarifying questions on recently opened issues to move the discussion forward.

•	查看其他人提交的代码。
•	编写并完善项目文档。
•	整理一个示例文件夹，显示如何使用该项目。
•	回答有关项目的问题，例如Stack Overflow，
•	例如，通过以下方式使项目保持组织化：
o	链接到重复的问题。
o	建议新的问题标签。
o	处理未解决的问题并建议关闭旧问题。
o	对最近公开的问题提出澄清，以推动讨论的进行。

Closed software
闭源软件
What if you are working with people that do not use the open source model for their software? This may initially seem an affront to all the principles discussed so far, but there are usually very good reasons for why things are the way they are (for example legal, commercial, or security). Often, it will still be possible to use and contribute but the details of how might be different. The kinds of practices used in ‘closed’ software are generally the same and the concepts and tools you can learn about in the Turing Way still apply.
如果您与不使用开源软件模型的人一起工作怎么办？最初，这似乎是对到目前为止讨论中提到的所有原则的冒犯，但通常有很好的理由说明事物的状态（例如法律，商业或安全）。有时，它仍然可以使用和做出贡献，但是具体细节可能有所不同。闭源软件中使用的做法通常是相同的，并且您仍可以使用在the Turing Way中学习的概念和工具。

Sometimes, however, there might not be good reasons for the closed source approach. Different areas of research have different cultures which run against the grain of open principles and feel very frustrating. Tackling this barrier can be very tricky as cultures can take years or decades to change.
但是，有时候，采用闭源资源可能没有充分的理由。不同的研究领域具有不同的文化，这些文化与开放原则背道而驰，令人感到非常沮丧。解决这一障碍可能非常棘手，因为文化可能需要数年或数十年才能改变。

Working with closed software can offer both opportunities and threats to your research. In all cases, understanding and respecting other’s perspectives offers the greatest chances of success.
使用闭源软件可以即为您的研究带来机遇，也可能带来威胁。因此，理解和尊重他人的观点才能提供最大的成功机会。

Open hardware
开源硬件
“Open hardware”, or “open source hardware”, refers to the design specifications of a physical object that are licenced in such a way that said object can be studied, modified, created, and distributed by anyone. Like open source software, the “source code” for open hardware - schematics, blueprints, logic designs, Computer Aided Design (CAD) drawings or files, and the like, is available for modification or enhancement by anyone. Users with access to the tools that can read and manipulate these source files can update and improve the physical device and the code that underlies it, and, if they wish, proceed to share such modifications.
 “开源硬件”或“公开源代码硬件”指的是物理对象的设计规范，其许可方式使得任何人都可以研究，修改，创建和分发该对象。像开源软件一样，开放硬件的“源代码”（原理图，蓝图，逻辑设计，计算机辅助设计（CAD）图或文件等）可供任何人进行修改或增强。有权使用可以读取和操纵这些源文件的工具的用户可以更新和改进物理设备及其基础代码，并且，如果他们愿意，可以共享这些修改。

Open hardware’s source code should be readily accessible, and its components are preferably easy for anyone to obtain. Essentially, open hardware eliminates common roadblocks to the design and manufacture of physical goods; it provides as many people as possible the ability to construct, remix, and share their knowledge of hardware design and function.
开源硬件的源代码应易于访问，并且其组件最好易于任何人获取。从本质上讲，开放式硬件消除了设计和制造实物商品的常见障碍；它为尽可能多的人提供了构建，重新混合和共享其硬件设计和功能知识的能力。

It is worth noting that open hardware does not necessary mean free. Units may still be sold (by the original designer or by others), but users could build them from scratch. Whether or not they choose to buy the unit, users can still get a full understanding of how the hardware works from open documentation, designs, and similar.
值得注意的是公开硬件并不意味着必须免费。单位仍可以出售（由原始设计者或其他人出售），但用户可以根据草稿图制造它。无论他们是否选择购买该装置，用户仍然可以通过开放的文档，设计等获得对硬件工作原理的全面了解。

Why open hardware?
为什么要开源硬件
Open hardware allows researchers to understand exactly what their equipment is doing, how it is doing it, and to verify that it is doing it correctly, rather than having to extend a degree of trust. Being aware of how the equipment that generates a result works puts researchers on a firmer footing in assessing those results. Open hardware also makes research more reproducible as researchers looking to verify results can do the same thing.
开源硬件可以使研究人员准确了解设备的运行情况，运行方式，并验证设备是否正确运行，而不是一味的扩大信任。了解产生结果的设备是如何工作的，使研究人员可以更坚定地评估这些结果。开源硬件还使研究更具可重复性，因为希望验证结果的研究人员可以做同样的事情。

Other benefits of open hardware include protection against lock-in. Proprietary software for core infrastructure increases the risk of becoming locked in by the vendor or technology. If this happens, researchers can be at the mercy of vendors’ price increases and experience a lack of flexibility they can not easily and readily escape. Further, if researchers want to modify their equipment to better suit their needs it is much easier to do so (and may only be legal) in the case of open source hardware.
开源硬件的其他好处包括防止技术封锁。核心基础架构的专有软件增加了被供应商或技术封锁的风险。如果发生这种情况，研究人员可能会受供应商提价的摆布，并缺乏无法轻易 摆脱的灵活性。此外，如果研究人员想要修改设备以更好地适应他们的需求，那么在开源硬件的情况下，这样做会容易得多（可能只是合法的）。

Elements of an open source hardware project
开源硬件项目的元素
Here are some files that you should consider sharing when publishing your open source hardware project. You are not required to post them all, but the more you share the more the community benefits. There is a lot of crossover here with files to include in open source software projects.
以下是发布开源硬件项目时应考虑共享的一些文件。您无需全部发布它们，但是分享得越多，社区收益就越大。这里有很多交叉，文件包含在开源软件项目中。
•	Overview / Introduction: Your open source hardware project should include a general description of the hardware’s identity and purpose, written as much as possible for a general audience. That is, explain what the project is and what it is for before you get into the technical details. A good photo or rendering can help a lot here.
概述/简介：您的开源硬件项目应包括对硬件定义和用途的一般描述，并尽量面向大众。也就是说，在进入技术细节之前，请先解释项目的含义和目的。好的照片或透视图会有所帮助。

•	A licence: This grants legal permission to anyone to re-use, modify, and distribute your designs and hardware according to the terms stated (for example, they must acknowledge your contribution).
许可证：这是一份法律许可，授予任何人根据所述条款可重复使用，修改和分发您的设计和硬件（例如，他们必须承认您的贡献）。
•	Original design files: These are the original source files that you would use to make modifications to the hardware’s design. The act of sharing these files is the core practice of open source hardware.
原始设计文件：这些是用于修改硬件设计的原始源文件。共享这些文件的行为是开源硬件的核心尝试。

o	Ideally, your open source hardware project would be designed using a free and open source software application, to maximize the ability of others to view and edit it. For better or worse however, hardware design files are often created in proprietary programs and stored in proprietary formats. It is still essential to share these original design files; they constitute the original “source code” for the hardware. They are the very files that someone will need in order to contribute changes to a given design.
理想情况下，将使用免费的开源软件应用程序设计您的开源硬件项目，以最大程度地提高他人查看和编辑它的能力。但是，无论好坏，通常都在专有程序中创建硬件设计文件并以专有格式存储它们。共享这些原始设计文件仍然很重要；它们构成了硬件的原始“源代码”。它们是某人为给定设计做出更改所需要的文件。
o	Try to make your design files easy for someone else to understand. In particular, organize them in a logical way, comment complex aspects, and note any unusual manufacturing procedures.
尝试使您的设计文件易于其他人理解。特别是，以合理的方式组织它们，对于复杂的部分进行注释，并标注任何不寻常的制作过程。

o	Examples of Original Design Files include 2D drawings and computer-aided design (CAD) files.
原始设计文件的示例包括2D工程图和计算机辅助设计（CAD）文件。

•	Auxiliary Design Files: Beyond the original design files, it is often helpful to share your design in additional, more accessible formats. For example, best practice open sourcing a CAD design is to share the design not just in its native file format, but also in a range of interchange and export formats that can be opened or imported by other CAD programs.
辅助设计文件：除了原始设计文件之外，以其他更易于访问的格式共享您的设计通常也很有帮助。例如，开源的CAD就有着很好的共享设计，不仅可以用原始格式进行共享，而且可以由其他CAD程序打开或导入的互换和导出格式的范围共享。

o	It is also helpful to provide ready-to-view outputs that can easily be viewed by end users who wish to understand (but not necessarily modify) the design. For example, a PDF of a circuit board schematic. These auxiliary design files allow people to study the design of the hardware, and sometimes even fabricate it, even without access to particular proprietary software packages. However, note that auxiliary design files are never recommended as substitutes for original design files.
提供准备好的输出情况可以是那些希望理解设计（并不一定非要修改）的用户。比如，一个关于电路板原理图的PDF。这些辅助设计文件使人们可以研究硬件设计，有时甚至可以在不访问特定专有软件包的情况下进行制造。但是，请注意，永不建议使用辅助设计文件来代替原始设计文件。

•	Additional technical drawings: In their original formats, if required for fabrication of the device, in a commonly-readable format such as PDF.
其他技术图纸：以原始格式（如果需要制造设备）为通常可读的格式，例如PDF。
•	Bill Of Materials: While it might be possible to infer from the design files which parts make up a piece of hardware, it is important to provide a separate bill of materials. This can be a spreadsheet (for example, CSV, XLS, Google Doc) or simply a text file with one part per line.
材料清单：虽然可以从设计文件中推断出哪些零件组成了硬件，但是提供单独的材料清单很重要。这可以是电子表格（例如CSV，XLS，Google Doc），也可以只是一个文本文件，每行包含一个部分。
o	Useful things to include in the bill of materials are part numbers, suppliers, costs, and a short description of each part. Make it easy to tell which item in the bill of materials corresponds to which component in your design files: use matching reference designators in both places, provide a diagram indicating which part goes where, or otherwise explain the correspondence.
物料清单中包含的有用信息是零件编号，供应商，成本以及每个零件的简短描述。轻松分辨物料清单中的哪个项目与您的设计文件中的哪个组件相对应：在两个地方都使用匹配的参考标号，提供一个可以找到对应位置的标号或者以其他方式解释对应关系。
•	Software and Firmware: You should share any code or firmware required to operate your hardware. This will allow others to use it with their hardware or modify it along with their modifications to your hardware. Document the process required to build your software, including links to any dependencies (for example, third-party libraries or tools). In addition, it is helpful to provide an overview of the state of the software (for example, “stable” or “beta” or “barely-working hack”).
软件和固件：您应该共享操作硬件所需的任何代码或固件。这将允许其他人将其与硬件一起使用或对其进行修改以及对硬件的修改。记录构建软件所需的过程，包括指向任何依赖项的链接（例如，第三方库或工具）。另外，提供有关软件状态的概述（例如，“稳定”或“ beta”或“很少工作的黑客”）很有帮助。

•	Photos: Photos help people understand what your project is and how to put it together. It is good to publish photographs from multiple viewpoints and at various stages of assembly. If you do not have photos, posting 3D renderings of your design is a good alternative. Either way, it is good to provide captions or text that explain what is shown in each image and why it is useful.
照片:照片可以帮助人们了解您的项目是什么，以及如何将它们组合在一起。发布来自多个视角和不同组装阶段的照片是很好的。如果你没有照片，发布3D效果图是一个不错的选择。无论哪种方式，最好是提供说明或文本，解释在每个图像中显示了什么以及为什么它是有用的。
•	Instructions and Other Explanations: In addition to the design files themselves, there are a variety of explanations that are invaluable in helping others to make or modify your hardware:
说明和其他说明：除了设计文件本身之外，还有许多说明对于帮助他人制造或修改您的硬件非常有用：
Making the hardware: To help others make and modify your hardware design, you should provide instructions for going from your design files to the working physical hardware. As part of the instructions, it is helpful to link to datasheets for the components / parts of your hardware and to list the tools required to assemble it. If the design requires specialized tools, tell people where to get them.
制作硬件：为了帮助其他人制作和修改您的硬件设计，您应该提供有关从设计文件到可用的物理硬件的说明。作为说明的一部分，链接到硬件组件数据的数据表并列出组装所需的工具会很有帮助。如果设计需要专用工具，请告诉人们从何处获得它们。
o	Using the hardware: Once someone has made the hardware, they need to know how to use it. Provide instructions that explain what it does, how to set it up, and how to interact with it.
•	使用硬件：一旦任何人已经使用了这个硬件，他们需要知道怎么去用它。提供介绍来说明它的功能，如何设置以及如何与之交互。

o	Design rationale: If someone wants to modify your design, they will want to know why it is the way it is. Explain the overall plan of the hardware’s design and why you made the specific choices you did.
设计原理：如果有人要修改您的设计，他们将想知道为什么你是用某种方式进行的。解释硬件设计的总体计划，以及为什么要做出特定选择。
o	Limit jargon: Keep in mind that these instructions may be read by someone whose expertise or training is different from yours. As much as possible, try to write to a general audience, check your instructions for industry jargon, and be explicit about what you assume the user knows.
限制术语：请记住，你写的介绍说明不但有专业人士也可能有很多与您不同的专业人进行阅读。尽可能尝试写给大众读者，检查您的行业术语说明，并明确假设用户知道。
o	Format: The instructions could be in a variety of formats, such as a wiki, text file, Google Doc, or PDF. Remember, though, that others might want to modify your instructions as they modify your hardware design, so it is good to provide the original editable files for your documentation, not just output formats like PDF.
格式：说明可以采用多种格式，例如Wiki，文本文件，Google Doc或PDF。但是请记住，其他人可能会在修改硬件设计时希望修改您的说明，因此最好为文档提供原始的可编辑文件，而不仅仅是PDF之类的输出格式。

Open source hardware processes and practices
公开硬件的过程和实践
Designing your hardware
设计你的硬件
If you are planning to open source a particular piece of hardware, following certain best practices in its design will make it easier for others to make and modify the hardware:
如果你计划公开你的硬件特定部分的源代码，遵循其设计中的某些最佳操作将使其他人更容易制造和修改硬件：
•	Use free and open source software design (CAD) tools where possible: If that is not feasible, try to use low-cost and/or widely-used software packages.
尽可能使用免费和开源软件设计（CAD）工具：如果不可行，请尝试使用低成本和/或广泛使用的软件包。
•	Use standard and widely-available components, materials, and production processes: Try to avoid parts that are not available to individual customers or processes that require expensive setup costs.
使用标准且广泛使用的组件，材料和生产过程：尽量避免用户个体无法使用的零件或需要昂贵安装成本的过程。
Hosting your design files
托管你的设计文件
A basic way of sharing your files is with a zip file on your website. While this is a great start, it makes it difficult for others to follow your progress or to contribute improvements. Using an online source-code repository (like GitHub, GitLab, or NotaBug) may be a better place to store your open source hardware projects.
共享文件的基本方法是在您的网站上使用zip文件。虽然这是一个很好的开始，但它使其他人很难跟随您的进度或做出改进。使用在线源代码存储库（例如GitHub，GitLab或NotaBug）可能是存储开源硬件项目的更好位置。
Distributing open source hardware
分发开源硬件
•	Provide links to the source (original design files) for your hardware on the product itself, its packaging, or its documentation.
在产品本身，其包装或说明文件上，提供指向硬件来源（原始设计文件）的链接。
•	Make it easy to find the source (original design files) from the website for a product.
从网站上轻松找到产品的来源（原始设计文件）。

•	Label the hardware with a version number or release date so that people can match the physical object with the corresponding version of its design files.
用版本号或发布日期标记硬件，以便人们可以将物理对象与其设计文件的相应版本进行匹配。
•	In general, clearly indicate which parts of a product are open source (and which are not).
通常，请明确指出产品的哪些部分是开源的，哪些不是。

Open access
开放存贮
What is open access?
什么是放开存贮
One of the most common ways to disseminate research results is by writing a manuscript and publishing it in a journal, conference proceedings or book. For many years those publications were available to the public if purchased by means of a subscription fee or individually. However, new knowledge is built by synthesizing current scholarship and then building upon it. At the turn of the 21st century a new movement appeared with a clear objective: make all the research results available to anyone interested in reading it, free of charge by any user, with no technical obstacles such as mandatory registration or login to specific platforms. This movement took the name of Open access and established two initial strategies to achieve its final goal: self-archiving and open access publishing.
传播研究成果的最常见方法之一是撰写手稿，然后将其发布在期刊，会议论文集或书籍中。多年来，这些出版物通过订阅费或单独购买的方式向公众开放。但是，新知识是通过综合现有的学术知识而建立起来的。在21世纪之交，出现了一个新的运动，其目标明确：将所有研究结果提供给有兴趣阅读的任何人，任何用户免费，没有诸如强制注册或登录特定平台等技术障碍。该运动以开放获取为名，并建立了两个实现其最终目标的初始策略：自存档和开放获取发布。
Repositories and self-archiving
储存库和自我存档
The aim of the self-archiving movement is to provide tools and assistance to scholars to deposit their refereed journal articles in open electronic repositories. As a result of the first strategy we see self-archiving practices: researchers depositing and disseminating papers in institutional or subject based repositories. There has also been a growth in the publication of preprints through institutional repositories and preprint servers. Preprints are widely used in physical sciences and now emerging in life sciences and other fields. Preprints are documents that have not been peer reviewed but are considered as a complete publication in a first stage. Some of the preprint servers include open peer review services and the availability to post new versions of the initial paper once reviewed by peers.
自我存档运动的目的是为学者提供工具和协助，以将其参考期刊文章存放在开放的电子资源库中。作为第一个策略的结果，我们认为自存档实践：研究人员在机构或基于主题的存储库中存储和分发论文。通过机构资料库和预印本服务器发布预印本的情况也有所增加。预印本已广泛用于物理科学，现在正出现在生命科学和其他领域。预印本是未经同行评审但在第一阶段被视为完整出版物的文件。一些预印服务器包括开放的同行评审服务，以及在同行评审后可以发布新版本的初始论文的功能。

At the beginning of 2019 more than 4000 repositories are available for researchers to self-archive their publications according to the registry of open access repositories. In this list there are institutional repositories, subject based or thematic repositories, and harvesters. Institutional repositories are generally managed by research performing institutions to provide to their community a place to archive and share openly papers and other research outputs. Subject based repositories are usually managed by research communities and most of the contents are related to a certain discipline. Finally, harvesters aggregate content from different repositories becoming sites to perform general searches and build other value-added services.

在2019年初，根据开放存取存储库的注册表，研究人员可以使用4000多个存储库对自己的出版物进行自我存档。在此列表中，有机构存储库，基于主题的存储库或主题存储库以及收割机。机构资料库通常由研究执行机构进行管理，以向其社区提供一个地方，以存档和公开共享论文和其他研究成果。基于主题的存储库通常由研究社区管理，并且大多数内容都与某个学科相关。最终，收割者将来自不同存储库的内容聚合为站点，以执行常规搜索并构建其他增值服务。

When choosing a journal to publish research results, researchers should take a moment to read the journal policy regarding the transfer of copyright. Many journals still require for publication that authors transfer full copyright. This transfer of rights implies that authors must ask for permission to reuse their own work beyond what is allowed by the applicable law, unless there are some uses already granted. Such granted uses may include teaching purposes, sharing with colleagues, and self-archiving by researchers of their papers in repositories. Sometimes there a common policy among all the journals published by the same publishers but in general journals have their own policy, especially when they are published on behalf of a scientific society. When looking at the self-archiving conditions we must identify two key issues: the version of the paper that can be deposited and when it can be made publicly available.
选择期刊发表研究成果时，研究人员应花些时间阅读有关版权转让的期刊政策。许多期刊循序的出版仍然要求作者转让全部版权。权利的转移意味着作者必须寻求许可，才能超出适用法律允许的范围重复使用其作品，除非已授予某些使用权。此类许可用途可能包括教学目的，与同事共享以及研究人员将他们的论文保存在档案库中。有时，由同一出版商出版的所有期刊之间都有共同的政策，但一般而言，期刊都有自己的政策，特别是当它们代表科学社会出版时。在查看自存档条件时，我们必须确定两个关键问题：

Regarding the version, some journals allow the dissemination of the submitted version, also known as a preprint, and they allow its replacement for a reviewed version once the final paper has been published. Due to the increase of policies requiring access to research results, most of the journals allow self-archiving of the accepted version of the paper, also known as the author manuscript or postprint. This version is the final text once the peer review process has ended but it has not the final layout of the publication. Finally some journals do allow researchers to deposit the final published version, also known as the version of record.
关于版本问题，一些期刊允许转播已经提交的版本，我们通常称它为预印本，而且他们允许文章被接受之后，用修改过的版本替换最初的预印本。由于要求获取研究结果的政策的增加，大多数期刊允许对论文的公认版本进行自存档，也称为作者原稿或后印。这个版本是最终文本一旦同行审查过程已经结束，但它没有最终的出版物布局。最后，一些期刊确实允许研究人员存放最终发表的版本，也称为记录版本。
In relation to the moment to make the paper publicly available, many journals establish a period of time from its original publication - the embargo period, which can range from zero to 60 months - when making the paper publicly available is not permitted. Some journals include or exclude embargoes depending on the versions. For instance the accepted version could be made publicly available after publication but the published version must wait 12 months.
关于公开发表论文的时间，许多期刊都规定了从其首次成刊开始的一段时间-大概0到60个月，被称为封闭期-这是不允许此论文公开发布。根据版本的不同，某些期刊会包含或排除封闭期。例如，将接受的版本可以公开发布，但是发布的版本必须等待12个月。

Open access publishing
开源期刊发表
Open access publishing attempts to ensure permanent open access to all the articles published in journals, and as a result we have seen the creation of the open access journals. The number of open access journals has increased during the last years, according to the Directory of Open access Journals (DOAJ), currently there are more than 12,000. Open access journal must provide free access to its contents but it also must licence them to allow reusability.
开源期刊的发表形式试图确保对期刊中发布的所有文章进行永久开放访问，因此，我们已经看到了开放获取期刊的创建。根据开放获取期刊目录（DOAJ）的数据，最近几年开源期刊的数量有所增加，目前有12,000多种。开源期刊必须提供对其内容的免费访问权，但还必须许可文章被允许重复使用。

Currently many paywalled journals offer individual open access options to researchers once the paper is accepted after peer review. Those options include the publication under a free content licence and free accessibility to anyone since its first publication. This model is commonly known as the hybrid model because in the same issue of a journal, readers can find open access and paywalled contributions. Usually publishers ask for a fee to open individual contributions.
当前，一旦论文经过同行评审后被接收，许多付费期刊将为研究人员提供单独的开放访问选项。这些选项包括根据免费内容许可进行发布，以及首次发布后任何人都可以免费访问。该模型通常称为混合模型，因为在同一期刊中，读者可以找到开放获取和付费专区。通常，出版商要收取费用才能开始个人投稿。

Open access publishing has two primary versions — gratis and libre. Gratis open access is simply making research available for others to read without having to pay for it. However, it does not grant the user the right to make copies, distribute, or modify the work in any way beyond fair use. Libre open access is gratis, meaning the research is available free of charge, but it goes further by granting users additional rights, usually via a Creative Commons licence, so that people are free to reuse and remix the research. There are varying degrees of what may be considered libre open access. For example, some scholarly articles may permit all uses except commercial use, some may permit all uses except derivative works, and some may permit all uses and simply require attribution. While some would argue that libre open access should be free of any copyright restrictions (except attribution), other scholars consider a work that removes at least some permission barriers to be libre.
开源期刊有两个主要版本-免费和自由。免费开放访问只是使研究可供他人阅读而无需付费。但是，它不授予用户以超出合理使用范围的任何方式复制，分发或修改作品的权利。Libre免费开放是免费的，这意味着研究是免费的，但更进一步的是，通常通过知识共享许可，授予用户其他权利，从而使人们可以自由地重复使用和重新合成研究。开源访问有不同程度的考虑。例如，某些学术文章可能允许除商业用途之外的所有用途，有些可能允许除衍生作品以外的所有用途，而另一些则可能允许所有用途并且仅要求注明出处。

Why does open access matter?
为什么开放访问很重要？
Research is useless if it’s not shared; even the best research is ineffectual if others aren’t able to read and build on it. When price barriers keep articles locked away, research cannot achieve its full potential. Open access benefits researchers who can work more effectively with a better understanding of the literature. It also helps avoid duplication of effort. No researcher (or funder) wants to waste time and money conducting a study if they know it has been attempted elsewhere. But, duplication of effort is all-too-possible when researchers can’t effectively communicate with one another and make results known to others in their field and beyond. It also benefits researchers by providing better visibility and therefore higher impact/citation rate for their scholarship.
如果没有共享，研究是无用的。如果其他人无法阅读并以此为基础，即使是最好的研究也没有很有用处。当价格壁垒使文章无法进入时，研究无法发挥其全部潜力。开源期刊使研究人员能够更好地了解文献，从而更有效地开展工作。它还有助于避免重复劳动。如果研究人员（或资助者）知道在其他地方进行过研究，则不想浪费时间和金钱进行研究。但是，当研究人员无法有效地相互交流并使研究结果在其领域内及其他领域为他人所知时，完全不可能重复工作。通过提供更好的知名度，从而为他们的研究提供更高的影响/引用率，它也使研究人员受益。

Numerous publishers, both non-profit and for-profit, voluntarily make their articles openly available at the time of publication or within 6-12 months. Many have switched from a closed, subscription model to an open one as a strategic business decision to increase their journal’s exposure and impact. Further it can be argued that taxpayers who pay for much of the research published in journals have a right to access the information resulting from that investment without charge. Finally, if research is available to the widest possible pool of readers then it is more likely/easy for it to be checked and reproduced.
非营利性和营利性的众多出版商在出版时或6-12个月内自愿公开提供其文章。许多战略已经从封闭的订阅模式转变为开放的模式，这是一项战略性业务决策，旨在提高期刊的曝光率和影响力。此外，可以说，纳税人为期刊上发表的大部分研究付费，有权无偿获取该投资产生的信息。最后，如果对尽可能广泛的读者群提供了研究，那么对其进行检查和复制的可能性更高/更容易。

 Best practice for open access
开放存取的最佳做法
Self-archiving
自我存档
Self-archive a publication in a suitable repository, institutional or subject-based, following the possible restrictions posed by the publisher, for example an embargo period, or limits on the allowed version to be deposited in such archives. In doing this it is important to make sure you are aware of the copyright implications of any documents/agreements you make when submitting your manuscript to a journal. If your institution does not have an institutional repository, advocate for the creation of one.
遵循发布者可能的限制（例如，封锁期或对要存放在此类档案中的允许版本的限制），在机构或基于主题的适当存储库中自存档出版物。在此过程中，重要的是要确保您在将稿件提交给期刊时了解所做出的任何文档/协议所涉及的版权。如果您的机构没有机构存储库，请倡导创建一个。

Publication
Consider submitting your work to a journal that is open access. When doing this be aware that there may be funds or discounts available to cover any associated costs.
考虑将您的工作提交到开源期刊。在执行此操作时，请注意可能会有资金支付任何相关费用，有时可以享受折扣。

Open notebooks
打开笔记本
Electronic Lab Notebooks (ELNs) enable researchers to organize and store experimental procedures, protocols, plans, notes, data, and even unfiltered interpretations using their computer or mobile device. They are a digital analogue to the paper notebook most researchers keep. ELNs can offer several advantages over the traditional paper notebook in documenting research during the active phase of a project, including searchability within and across notebooks, secure storage with multiple redundancies, remote access to notebooks, and the ability to easily share notebooks among team members and collaborators.
电子实验室笔记本（ELN）使研究人员可以使用其计算机或移动设备来组织和存储实验程序，协议，计划，说明，数据，甚至是未经过滤的解释。它们与大多数研究人员使用的纸质笔记本类似。在项目的活动阶段，与传统的纸质笔记本相比，ELNs在记录研究方面有几个优势，包括笔记本内部和跨笔记本的搜索能力、多冗余的安全存储、对笔记本的远程访问，以及在团队成员和协作者之间轻松共享笔记本的能力。

Open notebook research is simply the practice of making such notebooks openly available, usually online. Some researchers choose to keep their notebooks open from the very beginning of their projects. Rather than wait months, even years, to share their research through journal publication as is the current practice, this allows researchers to post their experimental data and protocols online and in real-time. Sharing research in this open and timely manner helps to reduce duplication of work, helps foster new collaborations, and cultivates a more open dialogue with others. It also helps researchers avoid making exploring dead ends and making mistakes that have already been covered by their colleague, but went unpublished because of lack of scientific interest.
开放式笔记本研究只是使此类笔记本（通常是在线）公开可用的一种做法。一些研究人员选择从项目一开始就保持笔记本打开。与其像现在这样等待数月甚至数年，不如通过期刊出版共享他们的研究成果，这使研究人员可以在线和实时发布他们的实验数据和实验方案。以开放，及时的方式共享研究成果有助于减少工作重复，有助于促进新的合作，并与他人进行更开放的对话。它还可以帮助研究人员避免探究死胡同和犯错误，而这些错误已经被同事掩盖了，但由于缺乏科学兴趣而未发表。

Open notebooks have the further benefit of increasing the quality of scientific outputs by forcing researchers to be careful, thorough, and explicit. Making research open has the added benefit of increasing the likelihood that any errors made in an investigation will be spotted quickly, instead of down the line. Immediate fixes will have much less impact on a research project, which will save a research time, the lab money, and pride.
打开的笔记本还有一个好处，那就是迫使研究人员小心、彻底和明确地提高科研产出的质量。开放研究还有一个额外的好处，那就是增加了在调查中所犯错误被迅速发现的可能性，而不是一蹴而就。立即修复对研究项目的影响要小得多，这将节省研究时间、实验室资金和自豪感。
Ideally, every scientist would maintain an open notebook in real-time which would encompass all aspects of their research. But many fears about dealing with complete open access, conflicts with intellectual property and publications, and online data overload hamper this movement. To combat this, practitioners encourage any form of open notebook research, “make open what you can”, even if that means uploading some information for a project from many years ago that never saw the light of day.
理想情况下，每个科学家都应该实时地保持一个打开的笔记本，其中包含他们研究的所有方面。但许多人担心要应对完全开放获取、与知识产权和出版物的冲突，以及在线数据过载等问题，这些都阻碍了这一进程。为了解决这个问题，专业人士鼓励任何形式的开放笔记本研究，“尽可能地开放”，即使这意味着上传一些多年前从未见过天日的项目信息。
Open scholarship
开源科学
Open research and its subcomponents fit under the umbrella of a broader concept - open scholarship.
开放式研究及其子组件适用于更广泛的概念-开源科学。


 
Open educational resources
开放的教育资源
Open educational resources (OERs) are teaching and learning materials that can be freely used and reused for learning and/or teaching at no cost, and without needing to ask permission. Examples are courses, including Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs), lectures, teaching materials, assignments, and various other resources. OERs are available in many different formats compatible with online usage, most obviously text, images, audio, and video. Anyone with internet access can access and use OERs; access is not dependent on location or membership of a particular institution.
开放式教育资源（OER）是可以免费使用和重用于学习和/或教学的教学材料，无需征得许可。示例包括课程，包括大规模在线公开课程（MOOC），讲座，教材，作业和其他各种资源。OER具有多种与在线使用兼容的格式，最明显的是文本，图像，音频和视频。可以访问互联网的任何人都可以访问和使用OER；访问权限不取决于特定机构的位置或成员资格。

Unlike copyrighted resources, OERs have been authored or created by an individual or organization that chooses to retain few, if any, ownership rights. In some cases, that means anyone can download a resource and share it with colleagues and students. In other cases, this may go further and enable people to edit resources and then re-post them as a remixed work. How do you know your options? OERs often have a Creative Commons licence or other permission to let you know how the material may be used, reused, adapted, and shared.
与受版权保护的资源不同，OER由选择保留很少的所有权（如果有）的个人或组织创作或创建。在某些情况下，这意味着任何人都可以下载资源并与同事和学生共享。在其他情况下，这可能会更进一步，使人们可以编辑资源，然后将其重新发布为重新混合的作品。您怎么知道您的选择？OER通常具有知识共享许可或其他许可，以让您知道如何使用，重复使用，改编和共享材料。

Fully open OERs comply with the 5 Rs:
完全开放的OER应该符合以下五条原则：

•	Retain: the right to make, own, and control copies of the content.
保留：制作，拥有和控制内容副本的权利。

•	Reuse: the right to use the content in a wide range of ways (for example, in a class, in a study group, on a website, in a video).
重复使用：以多种方式使用内容的权利（例如，在课堂上，在学习小组中，在网站上，在视频中）。
•	Revise: the right to adapt, adjust, modify, or alter the content itself (for example, translate the content into another language).
修订：修改，调整，修改或更改内容本身的权利（例如，将内容翻译成另一种语言）。
•	Remix: the right to combine the original or revised content with other open content to create something new (for example, incorporate the content into a mashup).
重新合成：将原始或修订的内容与其他开放内容组合以创建新内容的权利（例如，将内容合并到合成中）。
•	Redistribute: the right to share copies of the original content, your revisions, or your remixes with others (for example, give a copy of the content to a friend).
重新分发：共享原始内容的副本，您的修订版本或与他人重新混合的权利（例如，将内容的副本提供给朋友）。

Researchers generate a great deal of educational resources in the course of teaching students and each other (at workshops, for example). By making these openly available, for example in the open educational resource commons, the wider community can benefit from them in three main ways:
研究人员在教学过程中产生了大量的教育资源。通过开放这些资源，例如在开放教育资源共享中，更广泛的社区可以从以下三个方面受益:
1.	Most obviously, the community can use the materials to learn about the material they cover.
最明显的是，社区可以使用这些材料来了解其涵盖的材料。
2.	Sharing resources reduces duplication of effort. If an educator needs materials for teaching and such materials already exist openly then they need not make their own from scratch, saving time.
共享资源减少了重复劳动。如果教育者需要教学材料并且这些材料已经公开存在，那么他们就无需从头开始制作，从而节省了时间。
3.	Making materials openly available helps a community build better resources by improving resources that already exist and combining OERs to take advantage of their different strengths, such as a great diagram or explanation.
公开提供材料可以通过改善现有资源并结合OER来利用其不同优势来帮助社区建设更好的资源，例如图或解释。

Beyond the raw practical benefits the worldwide OER movement is rooted in the human right to access high-quality education. This shift in educational practice is about participation and co-creation. Open Educational Resources (OERs) offer opportunities for systemic change in teaching and learning content through engaging educators in new participatory processes and effective technologies for engaging with learning.
除了原始的实际利益，全球OER运动还植根于获得高质量教育的人权。教育实践的这种转变是关于参与和共同创造的。开放式教育资源（OER）通过使教育工作者参与新的参与过程和有效的学习技术，为教学内容的系统性变革提供了机会。

Equity, diversity, inclusion
公平，多元化，包容
Open scholarship means open to everyone without discrimination based on factors such as race, gender, sexual orientation, or any number of other factors. As a community we should undertake to ensure equitable opportunities for all. We can go about that by deliberately fostering welcoming, inclusive cultures within out communities. For example, reasonable accommodations should be made wherever possible to include community members with disabilities to enable them to participate fully, and this can be as simple as choosing colourblind-safe colour schemes when making graphs.
开源科学是指对所有人开放，不受种族，性别，性取向或许多其他因素等因素的歧视。作为一个社区，我们应承诺确保所有人享有平等机会。为此，我们可以在社区内刻意培养热情，包容的文化。例如，应在任何可能的地方都做出合理的调整，以包括残疾社区成员，使他们能够充分参与其中，这就像在制作图表时选择色盲安全的配色方案一样简单。

Citizen science
公民科学
Citizen science is the involvement of the public in scientific research – whether community-driven research or global investigations, the Oxford English Dictionary recently defined it as: “scientific work undertaken by members of the general public, often in collaboration with or under the direction of professional scientists and scientific institutions”. Citizen science offers the power of science to everyone, and the power of everyone to science.
公民科学是公众参与科学研究的过程–不论是社区驱动的研究还是全球调查，《牛津英语词典》最近将其定义为：“一般由公众参与的科学工作，通常是与公众合作或在其指导下进行的。专业科学家和科研机构”。公民科学为每个人提供科学的力量，也为每个人提供科学的力量。

By allowing members of the public to contribute to scientific research, citizen science helps engage and invest the wider world in science. It also benefits researchers by offering manpower that simply would not be accessible otherwise. Examples of this include finding ways of folding molecules, and classifying different types of galaxies.
通过允许公众对科学研究作出贡献，公民科学有助于使更广泛的世界参与和投资于科学。它还通过提供人力资源来造福研究人员，而这些人力资源原本是无法获得的。这方面的例子包括找到折叠分子的方法，以及对不同类型的星系进行分类。
Patient and Public Involvement
病人与公共参与
Whilst citizen science encompasses one way of contributing to scientific research, Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) is a far more specialised form of citizen science which is particularly useful when doing research on health and/or social issues.
尽管公民科学是包含了对科学研究做出贡献的一种方式，但是患者和公众参与（PPI）是公民科学的一种更为专业的形式，在进行有关健康和/或社会问题的研究时特别有用。

PPI is not:
•	Participation: Recruitment of participants (such as for a clinical trial or survey) to contribute data to a project.
•	Engagement: Dissemination, such as presenting at patient interest groups or writing a blog post.
PPI is:
PPI不是
•	Involvement: patients and members of the public contribute at all stages of the research cycle.
参与度：患者和公众在研究周期的各个阶段都做出贡献。

When incorporating PPI into research, researchers work with volunteers, rather than doing work about them. PPI volunteers are usually patients or members of the public with a particular interest in some area of research which means that the topic is often very personal, and being involved in the research cycle can be an empowering experience. For the researcher, PPI often generates unique and invaluable insights from the volunteers’ own personal expertise which cannot always be predicted by the researchers themselves.
将PPI纳入研究时，研究人员与志愿者合作，而不是为他们做工作。PPI志愿者通常是对某些研究领域特别感兴趣的患者或公众，这意味着该主题通常是非常个性化的，并且参与研究周期可以成为一种赋权体验。对于研究者而言，PPI通常会从志愿者自身的专业知识中得出独特而宝贵的见解，而研究者本身并不总是能够预测到这些见解。

It is a good idea to consider PPI very early in a project, ideally before any grant applications or submissions for ethical approval have been written. PPI volunteers can help researchers in many ways, such as the following:
在项目早期就考虑PPI是一个好主意，理想情况是在编写任何赠款申请或道德批准的提交文件之前。PPI志愿者可以通过多种方式帮助研究人员，例如：
1.	Generate or shape research questions.
生成或塑造研究问题。
2.	Contribute to, or review, study design.
贡献或审查研究设计。
3.	Help with grant applications or submissions to research ethics committees (particularly the lay summary).
帮助研究伦理委员会申请资助或提交资助（特别是总结）。
4.	Collect data.
收集数据
5.	Analyse data.
分析数据
6.	Contribute to the manuscript and be listed as a co-author.
撰写稿件并被列为合著者。
7.	Disseminate findings in plain English.
用简单的英语传播调查结果。

One of the biggest barriers to PPI is not knowing how to get started. The UK National Institute for Health Research have their own site, INVOLVE, to help familiarise yourself with the foundations of PPI. Additionally, charities related to your specific research field may be able to facilitate or support PPI; for example Cancer Research UK and Parkinson’s UK have formal guides in place that provide a comprehensive overview of PPI.
PPI的最大障碍之一就是不知道如何入门。英国国家健康研究所拥有自己的网站INVOLVE，以帮助您熟悉PPI的基础。此外，与您特定研究领域相关的慈善机构可能能够促进或支持PPI；例如，英国的癌症研究中心（Cancer Research UK）和英国的帕金森大学（Parkinson's UK）都有正式的指南，可提供有关PPI的全面概述。

推荐技能水平：初学者-中级。版本控制具有许多有用的功能，但是并不需要完全掌握它。即使是初学者，如果很好地利用了一些最简单的功能，也可以节省大量时间，并可以大大提高工作的可重复性。当然，我们鼓励读者能用到整章的内容，但是如果不满意所有可用的工具，则不应该劝阻读者不要使用他们感到满意的某些工具。

Summary
总结
Version control keeps track of different versions of a project and allows past versions to be accessed easily. It also allows different versions of a project to be merged with minimal input from the user.
Version control is often associated with writing code, but it can also be used with writing projects. For example, if you are writing a paper with collaborators then version control is really important in helping you to see who has changed what.
Version control is used to some extent within many different programs, including ones you are likely to already be familiar with such as Word or Wordpress. There are numerous tools available for version control such as Mercurial and SVN.
The best know one is Git (and its web-based version, GitHub, which aids collaboration between researchers) which the instructions given in this chapter will be geared towards. There are a large number of detailed tutorials available online discussing the features and mechanics of how to use such systems (see the “Further reading” section at the end of the chapter). This chapter aims to cover the general principles underpinning all version control systems, and best practice which applies for using all such systems.
版本控制跟踪项目的不同版本，并允许轻松访问过去的版本。它还允许以最少的用户输入来合并项目的不同版本。
版本控制通常与编写代码相关联，但也可以与编写项目一起使用。例如，如果您正在与合作者一起撰写论文，则版本控制对于帮助您查看谁更改了内容非常重要。
版本控制在某种程度上用于许多不同的程序中，包括您可能已经熟悉的程序，例如Word或Wordpress。有许多用于版本控制的工具，例如Mercurial和SVN。
最有名的是Git（及其基于网络的版本，GitHub，这有助于研究人员之间的协作），本章中的说明将针对该GitHub。在线提供了大量详细的教程，讨论如何使用此类系统的功能和机制（请参阅本章结尾的“ 进一步阅读 ”部分）。本章旨在介绍支持所有版本控制系统的一般原则，以及适用于使用所有此类系统的最佳实践。
How version control is helpful
版本控制有何帮助
Researchers often have a large array of files (code, data, figures, notes) that they update but that they want to keep past versions of for reference. This process is often informal and haphazard, where multiple revisions of papers, code, and datasets are saved as duplicate copies with uninformative file names (for example, my_code.py my_code_2.py my_code_2a.py, my_code_2b.py). As authors receive new data and feedback from peers and collaborators, maintaining those versions and merging changes can result in an unmanageable proliferation of files. It is also incredibly error prone. It is easy to forget what different files contain, or to copy over files you do not mean to. This leads to a great deal of time wasted on figuring out what files contain and reproducing accidently overwritten files.
研究人员经常拥有大量文件（代码，数据，图形，注释），它们会更新，但他们希望保留以前的版本以供参考。此过程通常是非正式且随意的，其中将文件，代码和数据集的多个修订版保存为重复的副本，且文件名不具有信息性（例如，my_code.py my_code_2.py my_code_2a.py，my_code_2b.py）。当作者收到来自同行和合作者的新数据和反馈时，维护这些版本和合并更改可能导致文件数量难以控制的扩散。这也非常容易出错。很容易忘记其他文件包含的内容，或者复制您不想要的文件。这导致大量时间浪费在弄清文件中包含哪些内容以及重新生成的文件意外覆盖的原文件上。

One solution to these problems would be to use a formal Version Control System (VCS). A formal version is often a better solution than the lightweight version control that is often provided by text editing software packages. These systems have long been used in the software industry to manage code. Version control allows you to revert files you select back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified a file, find where and when a bug was introduced, and more. Using a version control system also generally means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover. In addition, you get all of this for very little overhead. Many people have felt the horror of losing days if not weeks of work when changes to a code break it irretrievably and can not be unpicked, and with this lies the key reasons to use version control: it removes risk and saves time.
解决这些问题的一种方法是使用正式的版本控制系统（VCS）。正式版本通常比文本编辑软件包提供的轻量级版本控件更好。这些系统早已在软件行业中用于管理代码。使用版本控制，您可以将选择的文件还原到以前的状态，将整个项目还原到以前的状态，比较一段时间内的更改，查看谁最后修改了文件，查找在何时何处引入了错误，等等。使用版本控制系统通常还意味着，如果您搞砸了或丢失了文件，则可以轻松恢复。此外，您只需很少的开销就能获得所有这些。很多人都有过这样的经历:当对代码的修改无法挽回且无法取消时，他们会损失几天甚至几周的工作时间，而这正是使用版本控制的关键原因:它消除了风险并节省了时间。

Keeping past versions of a project stored and accessible makes it possible to track its entire evolution, making the outputs far more reproducible. Version control software does this in a neat and powerful way, and it often saves researchers a great deal of time on reproducing lost code or analysis. Further, version control gives researchers more freedom to try things out and experiment. It does this by eliminating the risk of subsequent changes irrevocably ‘breaking’ the code as previous working versions will remain accessible regardless of how complex or how many changes are made.
保留项目的过去版本并可以访问，可以跟踪项目的整个演变过程，从而使输出的再现性更高。版本控制软件以一种简洁而强大的方式做到这一点，并且通常可以为研究人员节省大量时间来重现丢失的代码或分析。此外，版本控制使研究人员有更多的自由来尝试和试验。它通过消除后续更改不可避免地“破坏”代码的风险来做到这一点，因为无论进行了多么复杂或多少更改，以前的工作版本都将保持可访问性。

Another benefit of version control is that it makes collaboration easier, safer, and allows what changes have been made, when, why, and by who to be tracked. It does this by allowing different versions of a project (either two versions written by the same person, or versions from many people) to be worked on separately. It also has facilities to automatically compare and combine versions of a project, tasks which are often both fiddly and time-consuming when done manually.
版本控制的另一个好处是，它使协作更容易，更安全，并允许进行哪些更改，何时，为什么以及由谁进行跟踪。它通过允许不同版本的项目（由同一人编写的两个版本，或来自多个人的版本）分开进行处理来实现。它还具有自动比较和组合项目版本的功能，手动完成任务通常既费力又费时。

Version control: What it is and how it can be used to manage an evolving project
版本控制：它是什么以及如何将其用于管理不断发展的项目
What it is
这是什么
What is “version control” and why should you care? Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It is typically applied to managing changes in code, though in reality you can do this with nearly any type of file on a computer.
什么是“版本控制”，为什么要关心？版本控制是一个记录一段时间内对一个文件或一组文件的更改的系统，以便您以后可以调用特定版本。它通常用于管理代码更改，尽管实际上您可以使用计算机上几乎任何类型的文件来执行此操作。
The basic workflow
基础的工作流程
The typical procedure for using version control is as follows:
使用版本控制的典型过程如下：
1.	Create some files - these may be text or code.
创建一些文件-这些文件可以是文本或代码。
2.	Work on these files, changing, deleting or adding new content.
处理这些文件，更改，删除或添加新内容。
3.	Create a snapshot of the work at this time. This will be described differently in different software. Git will ask you to make a commit, other systems make ask you to make a timepoint or checkpoint or just to save your work.
此时创建工作的快照。在不同的软件中将对此进行不同的描述。Git将要求您进行提交，其他系统将要求您列出时间点或检查点，或者只是保存您的工作。

Keep doing work and making more and more snapshots. You can think of these as savepoints - if you need to go back to any point in time because of a mistake, or changing your mind about a decision, you can go back to get a file as it was then, or just return your entire project to a past state. An illustration of this is shown in the figure below.
继续工作并制作越来越多的截图。您可以将它们视为保存点-如果由于错误而需要返回到任何时间点，或者改变了决定的主意，则可以返回以获取当时的文件，或者只返回整个文件。投射到过去的状态。下图对此进行了说明。
 
In lots of version control systems you will be able to add a comment explaining what changes have been made in this version. These comments should be as clear as possible and make it easy to understand which version is which. This ensures that it is easy to find what you are looking for when you need to go back to a past version. Your collaborators will thank you, but so will future versions of yourself.
在许多版本控制系统中，您将能够添加注释，以说明此版本中进行了哪些更改。这些注释应尽可能清晰，并易于理解哪个版本。这样可以确保在需要返回到以前的版本时可以轻松找到所需的内容。您的合作者将感谢您，但您以后的版本也会如此。
Other facilities offered by version control
版本控制提供的其他功能
So you have your project and you want to add something new or try something out. With some of the more advanced version control systems (for example Git) you can make a branch to do this work on. Any work you do on your branch will not be present on your main project (referred to as your master branch) so it remains nice and safe and you can continue to work on it. Once you are happy with your New Thing you can ‘merge’ your branch back into your master copy.
因此，您拥有自己的项目，并且想要添加新的东西或尝试一下。使用某些更高级的版本控制系统（例如Git），您可以创建一个分支来进行此工作。您在分支机构上所做的任何工作都不会出现在您的主项目（称为主分支机构）中，因此它保持良好且安全，您可以继续进行工作。对新事物满意后，您可以将分支“合并”回主副本。
 
You can have more than one branch off of your master copy, and if one of your branches ends up not working you can either abandon it or delete it without the master branch of your project ever being impacted.
您的主副本可以有多个分支，并且如果其中一个分支最终无法正常工作，您可以放弃它或删除它，而不会影响项目的主分支。
 
If you want you can even have branches off of branches (and branches off of those branches and so on).
如果需要，您甚至可以从分支继续进行分支（每个分支都可以继续，并依此类推）。

 
No matter how many branches you have you can access past savepoints you made on any of them.
不管您有多少分支，您都可以访问您在任何分支上创建的过去的保存点。

Why should you use version control?
为什么需要使用版本控制
Version control can help you understand what changes you made in the past or why you did a certain analysis in the way you did it even weeks or months later when you have long since forgotten. By including comments and commit messages, each version can explain what changes it makes and what the version of the project it contains does. Commit messages also help others working on the same project to more easily understand what you did. This is helpful should you want to share your analysis (not only your data), and/or make it auditable – more generally, reproducible, which is good scientific practice.
版本控制可以帮助您了解过去所做的更改，或者为什么您忘记了很长时间后甚至几周或几个月后仍以某种方式进行某种分析的原因。通过包含注释和提交消息，每个版本都可以解释其所做的更改以及所包含项目的版本。提交消息还可以帮助从事同一项目的其他人更轻松地了解您所做的工作。如果您想共享您的分析（不仅是数据），并且/或者使其可审计（更一般地说，可重现），这是很好的科学实践，这将很有帮助。

A version control system stores all your changes neatly away so while it is still easy to access them your working directory is not cluttered by the debris of versions past that it is necessary to keep just in case. Similarly with version control there is no need to leave chunks of code commented should you ever need to come back to an old version again.
版本控制系统可以将所有更改整齐地存储起来，因此尽管仍然很容易访问它们，但是必须保持以防万一，您的工作目录不会因版本碎片而混乱。与版本控制类似，如果您需要再次回到旧版本，则无需注释掉大部分代码。

Finally version control is invaluable for collaborative projects where different people work on the same code simultaneously. It allows the changes made by different people to be tracked, and can automatically combine people’s work via merging saving a great deal of painstaking effort to do so manually. Moreover, version control hosting websites, such as GitHub, provide way to communicate in a more structured way, such as in code reviews, about commits and about issues.
最后，对于不同人同时使用相同代码的协作项目而言，版本控制是无价的。它允许跟踪不同人所做的更改，并且可以通过合并自动合并人们的工作，从而省去了手动进行的大量工作。此外，版本控制托管网站（例如GitHub）提供了一种以更结构化的方式进行通信的方式，例如在代码审查中，关于提交和问题。

Getting Started
入门
This is important to know, but it is not that exciting. Instructions for installing Git on linux, windows and mac machines are available here. Once installation is complete, to start using version control for your project you just go into the directory that contains all of your files (subdirectories will be included) and run:
要知道这一点很重要。此处提供了在Linux，Windows和Mac计算机上安装Git的说明。安装完成后，要开始为项目使用版本控制，只需进入包含所有文件的目录（将包含子目录）并运行：
git init
 
in the terminal to create the Git repository (often called “repo” for short). This only needs to be done once per project.
在终端中创建Git存储库（通常简称为“ repo”）。每个项目只需执行一次。

Think of the repository as a place where the history is being stored. Each file in your working directory can be in one of two states: tracked or untracked by your repository. In short, tracked files are files that Git knows about. Untracked files are everything else — any files in your working directory that were not in your last snapshot. When you first initialise a repository with git init all of your files will be untracked because your repository it does not have a previous snapshot yet, so it doesn’t know about any of your files. Therefore your next step is to add your files to the repository using:
将存储库视为存储历史记录的地方。工作目录中的每个文件可以处于以下两种状态之一：存储库已跟踪或未跟踪。简而言之，跟踪文件是Git知道的文件。未跟踪的文件就是所有其他内容-工作目录中不在上一个截图中的任何文件。当你第一次INITIALISE一个仓库git init所有的文件将是未追踪，因为你的仓库还不具备以前的截图，所以它不知道你的任何文件。因此，下一步是使用以下方法将文件添加到存储库：

git add .
 
This puts your changes into what is called the “staging area”. When you next commit any changes stored in your staging area will be recorded in your repository.
这会将您的更改放入所谓的“临时区域”。下次提交时，存储在暂存区中的所有更改都将记录在存储库中。

 
The full stop after git add above adds all changes to your staging area. So now all your files are staged commit them using:
git add以上的句号将所有更改添加到您的暂存区。因此，现在所有文件都已分阶段提交，请使用以下命令提交：
git commit
 
We will talk in more detail about these commands later, but for now just know if you run them then congratulations, you have finished setting up you repository!
我们将详细谈论这些命令后，但现在只知道如果你运行他们，那么恭喜你，你完成设置你的版本库！

Commits
责任
The problem
问题
When working on a project you will make numerous changes to your files as you progress. Sometimes you may need to undo changes, take another look at past versions, or compare versions. Saving each version individually (such as version_1.py and version_2.py) is messy and quickly becomes impractical.
在处理项目时，您将在进行过程中对文件进行大量更改。有时您可能需要撤消更改，重新查看过去的版本或比较版本。单独保存每个版本（例如version_1.py和version_2.py）很麻烦，并且很快变得不切实际。

The solution
解决方案
By making commits you can save versions of your code and switch between them/compare them easily without cluttering up your directory. Commits serve as checkpoints where individual files or an entire project can be safely reverted to when necessary.
通过提交，您可以保存代码的版本并在它们之间进行切换/轻松比较，而不会造成目录混乱。提交用作检查点，在必要时可以将单个文件或整个项目安全地还原到这些检查点。

How to do it
怎样做
When you have made a series of changes and you want to commit them you first add these changes to your staging area using git add. You can add all your changes using:
进行了一系列更改后，要提交更改，请先使用将这些更改添加到暂存区git add。您可以使用以下方法添加所有更改：
git add .
 
or you can add the changes to specific files via: 
或者您可以通过以下方式将更改添加到特定文件：

git add your_file_name

If you are ever unsure what files have been added, what files have been changed, what files are untracked, you can run the following to find out:
如果您不确定添加了哪些文件，更改了哪些文件，取消跟踪了哪些文件，则可以运行以下命令进行查找：
git status
 
When you’re ready you can commit everything in your staging area by running
准备就绪后，您可以通过运行以下命令在暂存区中提交所有内容：
git commit
 
It’s that easy.
就这么简单。
You can see a log of your previous commits using
您可以使用查看以前提交的日志
git log
 
In this log you’ll see that each commit is automatically tagged with a unique string of numbers and letters called a SHA which you can use to access and compare them.
在此日志中，您将看到每个提交都被自动标记有称为SHA的唯一数字和字母字符串，可用于访问和比较它们。
Retrieving past versions
检索过去的版本
To cancel your latest commit run
取消最近的一次的提交
git revert HEAD
 
which automatically makes a new commit that undoes those changes. You may want to retrieve a version form weeks or months ago. To do this first use git log to find the SHA of the version you want to retrieve. To reset your entire project to this version do
它会自动进行新的提交，从而撤消那些更改。您可能需要在几周或几个月前检索版本表单。为此，首先使用git日志查找要检索的版本的SHA。要将整个项目重置为此版本，请执行
git checkout SHA_of_the_version
 
You may just want the old version of a single file though, and not the previous version of the whole project. To retrieve this use
您可能只需要单个文件的旧版本，而不想要整个项目的旧版本。检索此用途

 git checkout SHA_of_the_version -- your_file_name
 
Good practice
好的做法
Commits should be ‘atomic’. That is, they should do one simple thing and they should do it completely. For example, adding a new function or renaming a variable. If a lot of different changes to your project are all committed together then if something goes wrong it can be hard to unpick what in this set of changes if causing the problem, and undoing the whole commit may throw away valid and useful work along with the bug. That said you do not necessarily need to do per-file commits. For example if I add a figure to this chapter here, let’s choose something to catch the attention of someone skimming through:
提交应该是“自动化的”。也就是说，他们应该做一件简单的事情，并且应该完全做到这一点。例如，添加新功能或重命名变量。如果将项目的许多不同更改全部提交到一起，那么如果出现问题，则可能很难取消选择这组更改中的哪些操作（如果引起问题），并且撤消整个提交操作可能会丢掉有效且有用的工作以及错误。也就是说，您不一定需要执行每个文件的提交。例如，如果我在这一章中添加一个图形，让我们用一些东西来吸引其他人的注意力:

 
then when I do this two files are changed:
然后当我做这两个文件被更改：
1.	The figure file has been added.
图文件已添加。

2.	I have added a reference to this figure in the chapter so it will be displayed.
我已经在本章中添加了对此图的引用，以便将其显示出来。

So two files are affected, but “Add figure to version control chapter” is a single, atomic unit of work, so only one commit is necessary.
虽然，两个文件受到影响，但是“将图添加到版本控制章节”是单个工作单元，因此只需要提交一次。
To aid in making atomic commits it is good practice to specify the files to be committed, that is, adding files to the staging area by name (git add your_file_name) rather than adding everything (git add .). This prevents you from unintentionally bundling different changes together, for example if you have made a change to file A while primarily working on file B you may have forgotten this when you go to commit, and with git add . file A would be brought along for the ride.
为了帮助进行快速提交，推荐作法是指定要提交的文件，即，通过名称（git add your_file_name）将文件添加到暂存区，而不是添加所有内容（git add .）。这可以防止您无意间将不同的更改捆绑在一起，例如，如果您主要在文件B上工作时对文件A进行了更改，则在提交时可能已经忘记了这一点，并且使用git add. 文件A会被带上。

Finally, do not commit anything that can be regenerated from other things that were committed unless it is something that would take hours to regenerate. Generated files just clutter up your repository and may contain features such as timestamps that can cause annoying merge conflicts (see below). On a similar note you should not commit configuration files, specifically configuration files that might change from environment to environment. You can instruct Git to ignore certain files by creating a file called .Gitignore and including their names in it.
最后，请勿提交任何可以从其他提交的内容中重新生成的内容，除非重新生成需要花费数小时的时间。生成的文件只会使您的存储库变得混乱，并且可能包含诸如时间戳之类的功能，这些功能可能会导致令人讨厌的合并冲突（请参阅下文）。同样，您不应提交配置文件，尤其是可能因环境而异的配置文件。您可以通过创建一个名为的文件.Gitignore并在其中包含其名称来指示Git忽略某些文件。

Commit messages
提交讯息
The problem
问题
As you work on you project you will make more and more commits. Without any other information it can be hard to remember which version of your project is in which. Storing past versions is useless if you can not understand them, and figuring out what they contain by inspecting the code is frustrating and takes valuable time.
在进行项目时，您将进行越来越多的提交。没有任何其他信息，可能很难记住项目的哪个版本。如果您不了解它们，则存储过去的版本是没有用的，并且通过检查代码来找出它们所包含的内容令人沮丧，并且会花费宝贵的时间。

The solution
解决方案
When you commit you have the chance to write a commit message describing what the commit is and what it does, and you should always, always, always do so. A commit message gets attached to the commit so if you look back at it (for example, via git log) it will show up. Creating insightful and descriptive commit messages is one of the best things you can do to get the most out of version control. It lets people (and your future self when you have long since forgotten what you were doing and why) quickly understand what changes a commit contains without having to carefully read code and waste time figuring it out. Good commit messages improve your code quality by drastically reducing its WTF/min ratio:
当你提交你必须写一个提交信息描述什么的提交是和它做什么的机会，你应该总是，总是，是这样做。提交消息将附加到该提交，因此，如果您回头查看它（例如，通过git log），它将显示出来。创建具有洞察力和描述性的提交消息是您可以最大程度地利用版本控制的最佳方法之一。它使人们（以及您很久以来就忘记了自己在做什么和为什么的将来自己）可以快速了解提交所包含的更改，而不必仔细阅读代码并浪费时间弄清楚该代码。好的提交消息会通过大大降低其WTF / min比来提高代码质量：
 
How to do it
怎样做
When you commit via:
当你提交时应通过
git commit
 
notice that a field appears (either within the terminal or in a text editor) where a commit message can be written. Simply do so and save (and close if writing the message via text editor). To set your preferred editor as the default do:
请注意如果出现了一个字段，（无论是在终端中还是在文本编辑器中），可以在其中写入提交消息。只需这样做并保存（如果通过文本编辑器编写消息，则关闭）。要将首选编辑器设置为默认值，请执行以下操作：
git config --global core.editor "your_preferred_editor"
 
Good practice
好的尝试
The number one rule is: make it meaningful. A commit message like “Fixed a bug” leaves it entirely up to the person looking at the commit (again, this person may very well be you a few months in the future when you have forgotten what you were doing) to waste time figuring out what the bug was, what changes you actually made, and how they fixed it. As such a good commit message should explain what you did, why you did it, and what is impacted by the change. As with comments you should describe what the code is doing rather than the code itself. For example, it is not obvious what “Change N_sim to 10” actually does, but “Change number of simulations run by the program to 10” is clear.
第一法则是：使其有意义。诸如“修复错误”之类的提交消息完全由看该提交的人（再次，这个人很可能是您未来几个月忘记了所做的事情）来浪费时间弄清楚错误是什么，您实际进行了哪些更改，以及他们如何修复它。因此，良好的提交消息应说明您做了什么，为什么做以及受更改影响的内容。与注释一样，您应该描述代码在做什么，而不是代码本身。例如，“将N_sim更改为10”的实际作用并不明显，但是“将程序运行的模拟数量更改为10”是明确的。

Summarise the change the commit contains in the first line (50-72 characters), then leave a blank line before you continue with the body of the message. By doing this when shortened versions of git log are used just the summary will appear. This makes it much easier to quickly search through a large number of commits. It is also a good practice to use the imperative present tense in these messages. In other words, use commands. Instead of “I added tests for” or “Adding tests for”, use “Add tests for”.
总结这些改变
提交应包含在第一行（50-72个字符），然后在继续正文之前留空行。这样，git log在使用的简化版本时，只会显示摘要。这使得快速搜索大量提交变得更加容易。在这些消息中使用命令式现在时也是一种好习惯。换句话说，使用命令。代替“我为……添加测试”或“为……添加测试”，请使用“为……添加测试”。

Here is a good example of commit message structure:
这是一个提交消息结构的好例子：
Short (50 chars or less) summary of changes

More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to
about 72 characters or so. In some contexts, the first
line is treated as the subject of an email and the rest of
the text as the body. The blank line separating the
summary from the body is critical (unless you omit the body
entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run
the two together.

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

  - Bullet points are okay, too

  - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet,
    preceded by a single space, with blank lines in
    between, but conventions vary here
 
Comparing versions
比较版本
The problem
问题
At some point it is likely you will need/want to compare versions of a project, for example to see what version was used to generate a certain result.
在某个时候，您可能需要/想要比较项目的版本，例如查看用于生成特定结果的版本。

The solution
解决方案
In short: git diff.
Diffing is a function that takes two input data sets and outputs the changes between them. git diff is a multi-use Git command that when executed runs a diff function on Git data sources. These data sources can be commits, branches, files and more. 
Diffing是一个函数，它接受两个输入数据集并输出它们之间的变化。git diff是一个多用途的git命令，在执行时在git数据源上运行一个diff函数。这些数据源可以是提交、分支、文件等。 
How to do it
怎样做
By default git diff will show you any uncommitted changes since the last commit. If you want to compare two specific things the syntax is:
默认情况下，git diff将显示自上次提交以来所有未提交的更改。如果要比较两个特定的东西，语法是：
 git diff thing_a thing_b
 
For example if you want to compare how a file has changed between two commits use git log to get the SHAs of those commits and run:
例如，如果要比较两次提交之间文件的更改方式，请使用git log这些获取SHA的SHA并运行：

git diff SHA_a:your_file_name SHA_b:your_file_name
 
Or if you wanted to compare two branches it would be:
或者，如果您想比较两个分支，它将是：
git diff branch_name other_branch_name
 
Good practice
好的做法
Use it. With a little familiarity git diff becomes an extremely powerful tool you can use to track what files have changed and exactly what those changes are. This is extremely valuable for unpicking bugs and comparing work done by different people. Be careful to understand what exactly is being compared and where possible only compare the relevant files for what you are interested in to avoid large amounts of extraneous information.
使用它。稍微熟悉一下git diff就会成为一种功能非常强大的工具，您可以使用它来跟踪哪些文件已更改以及这些更改到底是什么。这对于发现错误和比较不同人员所做的工作非常有价值。请仔细了解正在比较的内容，并在可能的情况下仅比较您感兴趣的相关文件，以避免大量无关的信息。

Branches
分支
The problem

If you add a new feature to your project you run the risk of accidentally breaking your working code as you make changes to it. This would be very bad for active users of your project, even if the only active user is you. Also version control systems are regularly used for collaboration. If everyone starts programming on top of the master branch, it will cause a lot of confusion. Some people may write faulty/buggy code or simply the kind of code/feature others may not want in the project. There needs to be a way allow new work to be done on a project whilst protecting work that has already been done.
如果在项目中添加新功能，则可能会在更改代码时意外破坏工作代码。即使您是唯一的活动用户，这对于项目的活动用户也是非常糟糕的。版本控制系统也经常用于协作。如果每个人都在master分支的顶部开始编程，则会引起很多混乱。有些人可能会编写错误/错误的代码，或者只是其他人可能不想在项目中编写的代码/功能的类型。需要有一种方法可以允许在项目上完成新工作，同时保护已经完成的工作。

The solution
解决办法
Branches. At the start of this chapter an overview was given of the concept of branches, but let’s recap. You have a project, and you make commits on it. By default you have one branch, called ‘master’. Making a branch essentially makes a copy of your code which you can work on and continue to make commits to. Meanwhile your master branch is untouched by these changes, and you can continue to make commits on it too. Once you are happy with whatever you were working on on a branch you can merge it into your master branch (or indeed any other branch). Merging will be covered in the next section. If your work on a branch does not work out you can delete or abandon it (for example, Feature B in the diagram below) rather than spending time unpicking your changes if you were doing all your work on the master copy. You can have as many branches off of branches as you desire (for example, Feature A-1).
分支机构。在本章开始时，对分支的概念进行了概述，先让我们回顾一下。您有一个项目，并对它进行提交。默认情况下，您有一个分支，称为“ master”。建立分支实质上就是复制代码，您可以对其进行处理并继续进行提交。同时，您的主分支不受这些更改的影响，您也可以继续对其进行提交。一旦对分支上的工作满意，就可以将其合并到主分支（或其他分支）中。合并将在下一部分中介绍。如果您在分支上的工作无法正常进行，则可以删除或放弃该分支（例如，下图中的功能B），而不必花时间取消所做的更改（如果您在主副本上进行所有工作）。您可以根据需要从分支中创建任意多个分支（例如，功能A-1）。

Using branches keeps working code safe, particularly in collaborations. Each contibuter can have their own branch or branches which are only merged into the main project when they are ready. 
使用分支可确保工作代码安全，尤其是在协作中。每个连接器可以有自己的一个或多个分支，这些分支只有在准备就绪时才合并到主项目中。

 
How to do it
怎么做
You can create a branch and switch to it using:
您可以使用以下方法创建分支并切换到它：
git checkout -b name_of_your_new_branch
 
To change between branches:
在分支之间切换：
git checkout name_of_the_branch
though you must commit any work you have in progress before you will be able to switch. You can see all branches of your project simply using:
尽管您必须先进行一些工作，然后才能进行切换。您可以使用以下命令查看项目的所有分支：
git branch

which will output a list with an asterix next to the branch you are on. You can also use git status if you have forgotten which branch you are on. 
将会在您所在的分支旁边输出带有星号的列表。您也可以使用git status，如果你忘记了你是在哪个分支。

If you decide to get rid of a branch you can delete it with:
如果您决定摆脱分支机构，可以使用以下方法将其删除：
git branch -D name_of_the_branch
 
Good practice
好的做法
Branches should be used to keep the master branch clean. That is, master should only contain work which is complete and tested and so rightfully belongs in the master version of the project. Similarly you should try to keep individual branches as clean as possible by only adding one new feature per branch, because if you are working on several features some may be finished and ready to merge into master while others are still under development. Keeping your branches clean means only making changes related to the feature on the feature’s branch. Give your branches sensible names, “new_feature” is all well and good until you start developing a newer feature on another branch.
应该使用分支来保持主分支的干净。也就是说，master应该只包含完整且经过测试的工作，因此应正确地属于项目的master版本。同样，您应该尝试通过每个分支仅添加一个新功能来保持各个分支尽可能的干净，因为如果您正在使用多个功能，则某些功能可能已经完成并准备好合并到master中，而其他功能仍在开发中。保持分支干净意味着仅在功能分支上进行与功能相关的更改。给您的分支取一个合理的名称，直到您开始在另一个分支上开发较新的功能之前，“ new_feature”都很好。

Merging
合并
The problem
问题
Once you’ve finished up some work on a branch you need to integrate it to your main project (or any other branch).
完成分支上的某些工作后，您需要将其集成到主项目（或任何其他分支）中。
The solution
解决方案
Merge the branch with your work on into your target branch. You can also use merging to combine work that other people have done with your own and vice versa.
将分支与您的工作合并到目标分支中。您还可以使用合并功能将其他人所做的工作与您自己的工作进行合并，反之亦然。

How to do it
怎么做
To merge some branch, branch_A, into another branch, branch_B, switch to branch_A via git checkout branch_A and merge it into branch_B by:
想将某个分支branch_A合并到另一个分支branch_B中，请通过切换到branch_A，然后通过git checkout branch_A的方式将其合并到branch_B中：

git merge branch_B
 
Merging will not be possible if there are changes in either your working directory or staging area that could be written over by the files that you are merging in. If this happens, there are no merge conflicts in individual files. You need to commit or stash the files it lists and then try again. The error messages are as follows:
如果您的工作目录或暂存区中的更改可能被要合并的文件覆盖，则将无法合并。如果发生这种情况，则单个文件中没有合并冲突。您需要提交或隐藏它列出的文件，然后重试。错误消息如下：
error: Entry 'your_file_name' not uptodate. Cannot merge. (Changes in working directory)
 
Or或者
error: Entry 'your_file_name' would be overwritten by merge. Cannot merge. (Changes in staging area)
 
Good practice
好的尝试
First and foremost your master branch should always be stable, only merge work that is finished and tested into it. If your project is collaborative then it is a good idea to merge changes that others make into you own work frequently. If you do not it is very easy for merge conflicts to arise (next section). Similarly, share your own changes with your collaborators often.
首先，您的master分支应该始终保持稳定，仅将完成并测试的工作合并到其中。如果您的项目是协作的，那么最好将其他人所做的更改频繁合并到您自己的工作中。如果您不这样做，则很容易发生合并冲突（下一部分）。同样，经常与合作者共享您自己的更改。
Merge conflicts
合并冲突
The problem
问题
When changes to made to the same file on different branches sometimes those changes may be incompatible. This most commonly occurs in collaborative projects, but it happens in solo projects too. Let’s say there’s a project and it contains a file with this line of code:
当在不同分支上对同一文件进行更改时，有时这些更改可能不兼容。这最常发生在协作项目中，但也发生在单独项目中。假设有一个项目，它包含带有以下代码行的文件：
print('hello world')
 
Lets say one person, on their branch, decides to pep it up a bit and changes this line to:
假设一个人在其分支机构上决定将其加上感叹号：
print('hello world!!!')
 
while someone else on another branch instead decides to change print('hello world') to:
而另一个分支上的其他人则决定更改print('hello world')为：
print('Hello World')
 
They continue doing work on their respective branches and eventually decide to merge. Their version control software then goes through and combines their changes into a single version of the file, but when it gets to the hello world statement it doesn’t know which version to use. This is a merge conflict: incompatible changes have been made to the same file.
他们继续在各自的分支机构工作，并最终决定合并。然后，他们的版本控制软件将其更改组合到一个文件的单个版本中，但是当它进入hello world语句时，它不知道要使用哪个版本。这是合并冲突：对同一文件进行了不兼容的更改。
The solution
解决方案
When a merge conflict arises it will be flagged during the merge process. Within the files with conflicts the incompatible changes will be marked so you can fix them:
发生合并冲突时，将在合并过程中对其进行标记。在存在冲突的文件中，将标记为不兼容的更改，以便您可以修复它们：
<<<<<<< HEAD
print('hello world!!!')
=======
print('Hello World')
>>>>>>> master
 
<<<<<<<: Indicates the start of the lines that had a merge conflict. The first set of lines are the lines from the file that you were trying to merge the changes into.
<<<<<<<：这个表示这是具有合并冲突的的第一行。

=======: Indicates the break point used for comparison. Breaks up changes that user has committed (above) to changes coming from merge (below) to visually see the differences.
=======:这个标志表示用户已提交的更改(上面)分解为来自merge(下面)的更改，以直观地查看差异。
>>>>>>>: Indicates the end of the lines that had a merge conflict. 
>>>>>>>: 表示这是有着合并冲突的最后一行。

How to do it 
怎么做
You resolve a conflict by editing the file to manually merge the parts of the file that Git had trouble merging. This may mean discarding either your changes or someone else’s or doing a mix of the two. You will also need to delete the <<<<<<<, =======, and >>>>>>> in the file. So in this project the users may decide in favour of one hello world over another, or they may decide to replace the conflict with:
您可以通过编辑文件来手动合并文件中Git遇到合并困难的部分，从而解决冲突。这可能意味着要么放弃您的更改，要么放弃其他人的更改，或者将两者混合使用。你还需要删除< < < < < < < = = = = = = =,,> > > > > > >的文件。因此，在这个项目中，用户可能会决定选择一个hello world，而不是另一个hello world，或者他们可能会决定将冲突替换为:
print('Hello World!!!')
 
Once you have fixed the conflicts commit the new version. You have now resolved the conflict. If, during the process, you need a reminder of which files the conflicts are in you can use git status to find out.
一旦你修复了冲突，则可以提交新版本。您现在已经解决了冲突。如果在此过程中需要提醒冲突所在的文件，则可以使用git status来查找。

If you find there are particularly nasty conflicts and you want to abort the merge you can using:
如果发现特别令人讨厌的冲突，并且想要中止合并，则可以使用：
git merge --abort
 
Good practice
好的做法
Before you start trying to resolve conflicts make sure you fully understand the changes and how they are incompatible. If you do not you risk making things more tangled. Once you do and you go about fixing the problem be careful, but do not be afraid; the whole point of version control is your past versions are all safe. Nevertheless merge conflicts can be intimidating to resolve, especially if you are merging branches that diverged a great many commits ago which may now have many incompatibilities. This is why it is good practice to merge other’s changes into your work frequently.
在开始解决冲突之前，请确保您完全了解这些更改以及它们之间的不兼容性。如果您不这样做，则有可能使事情更加纠结。但只要您这样做，则可以解决问题，需要注意的是您应该小心，但不要害怕。版本控制的重点是您过去的版本都是安全的。但是，解决合并冲突常常令人畏惧，特别是如果您要合并分支，这些分支以前就有很多分散提交，而现在可能有许多不兼容之处。这就是为什么推荐您频繁地合并他人的更改。

There are tools available to assist in resolving merge conflicts, some are free, some are not. Find and familiarise yourself with one that works for you. Commonly used merge tools include KDiff3, Beyond Compare, Meld, and P4Merge. To set a tool as your default do: 
有一些工具可用于解决合并冲突，有些是免费的，有些不是。请选择并熟练掌握适合您的产品。常用的合并工具包括KDiff3，Beyond Compare，Meld和P4Merge。要将工具设置为默认值，请执行以下操作：

git config --global merge.tool name_of_the_tool
 
and launch it with: 
并使用以下命令启动它：
git mergetool
 
Fundamentally the best way to deal with merge conflicts is to, so far as is possible, ensure they do not happen in the first place. You can improve your odds on this by keeping branches clean and focused on a single issue, and involving as few files as possible. Before merging make sure you know what’s in both branches, and if you are not the only one that has worked on the branches then keep the lines of communication open so you are all aware of what the others are doing.
从根本上讲，解决合并冲突的最佳方法是，尽可能确保从头开始不会发生冲突。您可以通过保持分支的清洁，并总是专注于单个问题，尽可能少地包含文件来提高这一点的可能性。合并之前，请确保您知道两个分支中的内容，如果您不是唯一在两个分支上工作过的人，请保持通讯畅通，以便您都知道其他人在做什么。

GitHub
The problem
问题
When multiple people work on the same project (which is becoming more and more common as research becomes increasingly collaborative) it becomes difficult to keep track of what changes have been made and by who. It is also often difficult and time-consuming to manually incorporate the different participant’s work into a whole even if all of their changes are compatible.
当多个人在同一个项目上工作时（随着研究变得越来越需要协作，这个情况变得越来越普遍），就很难跟踪所做的更改以及更改的对象。即使不同参与者的所有更改都是兼容的，将其手动整合到一个整体中通常也是困难且耗时的。
The solution
解决方案
Hosting the project on a distributed version control system such as GitHub. Collaborators can then clone the project and work on the cloned copy making commits and new branches without impacting the original repository. Collaborators can then push their work to each other, and pull other’s work into their own copy. In this way it is easy to keep everyone up to date and to track what has been done and by who. GitHub also has numerous other handy features such as the ability to raise and assign issues, discuss the project via comments, and review each other’s changes.
Making the entire project and its history available online in this was also has two major benefits for research:
1.	Other researchers can re-use the work more easily. Rather than writing their own code to do what has already been written they can just use the original, which saves time. This also benefits the project’s original authors as other researchers are much more likely to build on the work (and cite it) if a great deal of the work has already been done.
2.	The research will be much more reproducible if the entire history of the project can be tracked. This enables results to be verified more easily, which benefits science.
How to do it
There are a number of GitHub tutorials available such as this one, or if you prefer you can follow along here.
First make an account on GitHub, and create a repository on it. To do this click the + sign dropdown menu in the upper right hand of the screen. Enter a name for the repository (ideally the same name as the project folder on your computer) and click Create Repository. Now you just need to link the project on your computer to this online repository. If your project is not already version controlled then make it so by running git init and making a commit. In the terminal on your computer use:
git remote add origin https://GitHub.com/your_username/repository_name
 
then push all the files on your computer to the online version so they match via:
git push -u origin master
 
You can the go on and make more commits on your computer. When you want to push them to your online version similarly you do:
git push origin branch_you_want_to_push_to
 
Others can then clone the repository to their computer by using:
git clone https://GitHub.com/your_username/repository_name.Git
 
They can make and commit changes to the code without impacting the original, and push their changes to their online GitHub account using:
git push -u origin master
 
Naturally the exact same procedure applies to you if you want to clone someone else’s repository.
Pull requests
So everyone’s got a copy of the code and they’re merrily working away on it, how do collaborators share their work? Pull requests. A pull request is a request for a person to pull someone else’s changes into their version on the project. Say person A has made changes they want to share with person B. On GitHub Person A needs to go to person B’s copy of the project and click the “New pull request” button. From there they can indicate which of their branches they would like person B to pull changes from, and which branch they want the changes pulled to. If person B accepts then person A’s changes will be merged into their repository by GitHub. They can discuss the request in comments, and make further commits to the request before it is accepted if necessary.
When person B is setting up the pull request GitHub will automatically check whether there would be any merge conflicts if they accept, and highlight them if there are. These can then be resolved in further commits before the request is accepted, keeping the merge clean and painless.
Once the request is accepted GitHub will merge person A’s changes into person B’s online copy of the repository. Person B can the pull those changes down to the copy on their computer using:
git pull origin master
 
It is also possible to make pull requests via the command line. A guide on how to do so is available here.
Good practice
In your GitHub repository you should include a license to allow others to re-use your work legally. GitHub makes this very easy, simply click the “Create new file” button, name it “License.md” and a drop down menu will appear offering you a selection to choose from. The legalese can seem intimidating however this website offers a very simple mechanism to help you pick the best license for your project.
You should also include a readme file where you include useful information about what the project is, how to use it and how to contribute to it. Switching between projects in your work is common, let alone that you might need to poke at your own previous projects from time to time. This information will also assist you collaborators, and your future employer might want to check your existing GitHub projects.
There are plenty of readme templates available online, pick one you like, but here is a list of the main things a readme should include:
•	The project name and what it is: This will greatly help the random prospective contributor to get an idea of the project. Include a few key points that describe the main features of the project and what are the main features you are implementing. This helps to quickly compare other projects with yours and to give an idea that why the project exists in the first place.
•	Instructions on how to install the project: The installer might be a collaborator, someone that comes across and is interested in the project, or even you if you get a new machine and need to re-install your project. Nevertheless, it’s a total waste of both of your resources to start figuring out how to just get started with the project. This should also include any prerequisites that will be needed to run the project. The best thing you can do is to just write up the installation instructions when you first do them yourself, and you will quickly save hours of work in the future.
•	Instructions for how to run the project and any associated tests: If you have been working on your project it may seem obvious how to run it, but this will likely not be the case for someone coming across it for the first time.
•	Links to related material.
•	List of authors/contributors to the project, possibly with contact information.
•	Acknowledgements.
It can be a good idea to include documents outlining a code of conduct, agreed ways of working, and contributing guidelines, though depending on the level of detail you want to provide the latter two can also work as sections within the readme. These documents make explicit expectations for those working on/contributing to the project, making life easier for everyone. Similarly depending on the scope of your project you may wish to provide templates for how contributors should make pull requests or raise issues.
You can also make use of one of GitHub’s major features- issues. Anyone can raise an issue with the project and discuss it. By making issues for any significant changes a record can be kept of the history of the project. GitHub has a myriad of other features such a milestones and project boards which may also be of use.
In pull requests you should clearly explain what the changes you’ve made are and why you made them. If your changes address and issue that has been raised reference it directly. If your request fixes and issue and you include “will fix #the_issue_number >” in the pull request, if the pull request is merged it will automatically close the referenced issue, keeping the issue queue nice and clean! This also works for using commit messages to close issues too.

What to learn next
Look into best practice for writing good quality code (for example, good naming conventions, informative comments, modular code structure). Many such skills are either also applicable for using version control well, for example, for writing good commit messages, or make using version control easier by keeping changes neat and localised.

Definitions/glossary
•	Add: Command used to add files to the staging area. Allows the user to specify which files or directories to include in the next commit.
•	Branch: A parallel version of a repository. Although it is contained within the same repository it allows you to develop it separately and then merge changes back into the ‘live’ repository or with other branches when appropriate.
•	Checkout: Git command to switch to a specific file, branch, or commit. Allows you to activate older versions of files or commits or switch between active branches.
•	Clone: Copy of an existing Git repository, normally from some remote location to your local environment. When you clone a repo you copy its entire history as well as all branches.
•	Commit: Snapshot of project history. A commit can be made after changes of a single file or a range of files and directories.
•	Commit message: A message the user can attach to a commit to explain what it contains.
•	Git: Version control system that GitHub is built around. It is a widely used open source distributed version control system developed by the author of Linux.
•	GitHub: An online hosting and version control service which centres around the version control software Git. It has a great many features to aid collaboration between users.
•	HEAD: the latest commit on the branch which is currently checked out
•	Issues: Bug tracking system for GitHub. Collaborators can use issues to report bugs, request features, or set milestones for projects. Issues are tracked, reported, and closed by collaborators during the development process. They’re a great way of communicating with your team and reporting progress.
•	Master: the repository’s main branch. Depending on the work flow it is the one people work on or the one where the integration happens.
•	Merge: The process of combining branches. Changes made on one or more branches are applied to another.
•	Merge conflict: Incompatibilities between branches being merged.
•	Pull request: Proposed changes to a remote repository. Collaborators without write access can send a pull request to the administrator with the changes they’ve made to the repo. The administrator can then approve and merge or reject the changes to the main repository. For open source projects pull requests can be sent by anyone that has forked a project.
•	Push: Sending changes to a remote repo. The remote repository is updated with the changes pushed and now mirrors the local repo.
•	Repository: Refers to a project folder that is being tracked by Git and containing project files. Also called ‘repo’ for short they can be local as well as hosted on GitHub.
•	SHA: Unique string of numbers of letters used to identify every commit or node in the repository.
•	Staged: Changes that will be included in the next commit.
